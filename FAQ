Ganymede Release 0.99.4
July 8, 1999
FAQ
---------------------------------------------

1) Is Ganymede secure from packet-sniffing?

   No. Ganymede has an effective internal security model, but all
communications between the client/console and the Ganymede server are
carried unencrypted.

2) That's dumb.  What kind of environment is Ganymede intended for, then?

   Ganymede is being developed in a laboratory in which a relatively
high level of trust is assumed behind the firewall.  Ganymede's
security and permissions model in this environment are designed for
administrative separation rather than to prevent hacking, although
everything possible short of transport-layer encryption has been
done to keep everything as safe as possible.

3) Any hope of a secure Ganymede for use in insecure networks?

   Quite possibly, yes.  The Java 1.2 platform includes support for
RMI over custom socket types, which could theoretically include SSL
encrypted sockets.  Most existing implementations of SSL sockets for
Java are both pricey and export-controlled, but there exists a team
working on a free SSL implementation for Java which is free and
export-controlled.  That team is known as Claymore Systems, Inc., and
you can read about their free implementation at

http://www.rtfm.com/puretls/

It looks as though they have a good bit of work left to do for a
turn-key SSL socket implementation on Java, but when this work is
further along is should be fairly straight-forward to implement a
secure Ganymede.

   People interested in spending some cash can get working SSL on Java
today.  Here are some links to SSL implementors for Java.. note that
some of these links include explicit details on how to support RMI
over SSL.

http://vonnieda.org/jSSL/        - Another free work.. still in progress?
http://www.ixworld.com/javassl/  - Not portable, requires binary NT SSLeay libs
http://www.phaos.com/            - Commercial, their SSLava stuff mentions RMI

4) What do I need to run Ganymede?

   The Ganymede distribution is packaged as a gzipped UNIX tar file,
and requires GNU tar to decompress it, due to extremely long
file/path names in the archive.

   Because the Ganymede distribution includes various symbolically linked
files, it is best unpacked and used on a UNIX system.  The Ganymede
server and clients should have no UNIX-specific code in them, but all
the build and install scaffolding requires Bourne shell and Perl 5.

   To run the Ganymede server on UNIX systems, you need Java 1.1.7 or
better for your system.  Since Ganymede supports running the Ganymede
client and admin console on Windows browsers with Sun's Plug-In (see
http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/jre/), you can get away with just
the basic Java environment on your UNIX system to run the server on.

   To run the Ganymede client and admin console on your UNIX system,
you will either need Java 1.2 or better for your system, or Java 1.1.7
or better and Swing version 1.1 or better.  Ganymede does not
currently have much in the way of text-mode clients, so X Windows is
essential.

   The Ganymede server is memory intensive, as all data registered in
Ganymede is kept in an in-memory database backed by disk.  A 64 meg
system dedicated to Ganymede is adequate to run a lab like ours, with
DNS for a couple thousand systems, and user, group, and email records
for around 1000 users.  More memory is better.  You'll probably want a
Pentium 200 or better for good performance on something like Linux.
JITs are great, anything with a good generational garbage collector
like Sun's HotSpot VM are super-great.

   To run the Ganymede client and admin console on Windows 95/98/NT,
you'll want Sun's Java Plug-In version 1.2.2 or later, and at least a
P133 with 32 megs.

5) How scalable is Ganymede, with its memory-based database?

   An excellent question.  The Ganymede server is extensively
multi-threaded and optimized, but memory is a fairly hard limit to get
around.  Without any data loaded, and using the latest JVM for Solaris
on UltraSPARC, the Ganymede server has a 57 meg memory image with
17 megs resident.  With all of ARL's data loaded and an admin console
attached, the server takes 58 megs memory image with 28 megs in-memory
resident.  That data compries:

   780 user/passwd records
   240 group records
   524 nfs volume definitions
   238 nis netgroup records
   1321 email alias records
   2676 i.p. addresses
   2553 dns records
   ~600 room/network connectivity records

or about 1.5 megs of data in the binary ganymede.db file.  At least
with Sun's VM, memory usage seems to go up fairly closely as the
amount of data in the ganymede.db file.  Even if we take the memory
resident measurement as a better indication of how much the data
in ganymede.db expands in memory, that's looking to be memory usage
of 10 times the size of the binary ganymede.db file.  

   Systems with 1 gig of RAM are not at all rare these days, so a
hundred meg database seems at least conceivable, or a database with
nearly 80,000 users and 255,000 systems.  Ganymede has not been tested
to this level, and it would take an extremely well tuned VM to handle
garbage collection for that size database, but Sun's HotSpot VM on a
multi-processor machine might have a decent go at it.  Whether the JVM
would handle i/o and threading for as many clients as is implied by
such a scale, and whether Ganymede's hashing data structures would
function efficiently at that scale are open questions.  The client
would certainly have scaling problems before that point, from a
user-interface standpoint if nothing else..

   I personally wouldn't bet on 80,000 users and 255,000 systems, but
8,000 users and 25,000 systems, or vice-versa should be very doable.

   Going to a disk-based database makes things a bit difficult in
Java, since Java doesn't make it possible to re-use memory buffers
intelligently.. a Ganymede server reading items out of an on-disk
database during run-time would be constantly creating new objects in
memory anyway, with garbage collection required to re-use the memory.
Java 1.2 supports a weak-references API that could be useful in
allowing more effective use of memory, but given the common database
access patterns (scanning all objects of a type to emit passwd, group,
dns files), it's unclear how much of a benefit this would bring.

6) Why isn't Ganymede LDAP-based?  What about replication?

   For a number of reasons, most having to do with the fact that
development on Ganymede started in early 1996, before LDAP was as
prominent as it is today.  Ganymede provides a lot of intelligence and
customizability that you don't get with a stock LDAP solution, and its
transaction and permissions models are superior to that of LDAP.

   The point of Ganymede is as much intelligent management of changes
and relationships as it is mass storage of data.  Because Ganymede has
a richer data model (object id's, symmetrical object pointers,
explicit representations of IP address data types), reworking Ganymede
on-top of LDAP would be difficult.  A lot of the intelligent
management of Ganymede would have to be sacrificed in such a move,
although the resulting system would probably be more scalable and
would have higher performance at the high end.

   Going to a multi-server Ganymede system, a la Active Directory and
NDS and LDAP servers generally might be interesting, but that would be
Hard.  All of the namespace indices used for unique-value management
and object locking would have to be coordinated across servers, and in
such a way that a server could go down and be brought back up without
losing such run-time state.  Also, the scripts to emit data from
Ganymede server's into local DNS, NIS, and the like would be complex.

   If your enterprise is too big for a single NIS domain and DNS
master server, you're probably too big for Ganymede.

7) What's up with DNS management?  The current stuff is weak.

   Yes, that's true.  We're working on code to support arbitrary DNS
management.  Instead of the current hosts_info file-of-evil that we
inherited from GASH, we're developing an XML-based DNS system that
will allow us to do both bulk and incremental DNS updates and, if we
play our cards right, even flexible BIND file importing.  It's coming.

8) Where's the documentation?

   What documentation do you want?  I know more and better docs are
needed, but feedback is pretty scarce.  Are the current docs adequate
at all?  Where does it break?  Ask questions, send mail to the
Ganymede mailing list (ganymede@arlut.utexas.edu).  Code development
is like a child's brain, it needs input.

9) How can I help?

   Send in bug reports and success reports, to
jonabbey@arlut.utexas.edu or, preferably, ganymede@arlut.utexas.edu to
send it to the mailing list.  If you are having problems or see an
issue, it's likely people on the list will be interested and have
something to say about it as well.

   For the feedback is the life.
