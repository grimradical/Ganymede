    <h1>Sample MOTD</h1>

    <p>This is a sample HTML version of a motd for the server.  It is stored in
      &lt;server install directory&gt;/db/text/motd.html.  It can and should be
      modified by your Ganymede administrator.  This text file can be edited at
      any time.  If it has changed since the last time a Ganymede user has logged
      in, the primary GUI client will display this file in HTML mode.</p>

    <p>This file may be removed from &lt;server install directory&gt;/db/text/, in
      which case the client will attempt to retrieve motd.txt from the same directory.</p>
