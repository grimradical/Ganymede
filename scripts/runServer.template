# Control variables

########################################

# DEBUG controls whether the JVM that runs the Ganymede server will
# allow a Java debugger to attach to it.  If you want to allow a Java
# debugger to attach to the server, set 'DEBUG=-Xdebug'.

DEBUG=

# MINHEAP controls the heap size that the JVM running the Ganymede
# server will initially allocate on startup, and which will be kept as
# a minimum heap size during execution. It should be expressed as a
# number followed by the letter 'm' for megabyte.  I.e.,
# 'MINHEAP=32m', or 'MINHEAP=64m'.

MINHEAP=32m

# MAXHEAP controls the maximum size the Ganymede server's heap can
# grow to.  It should be expressed as a number followed by the letter
# 'm' for megabyte.  I.e., 'MAXHEAP=256m', or 'MAXHEAP=2048m'.

MAXHEAP=1024m

# MAXPERMSPACE controls the amount of memory dedicated to class and
# method storage, and to interned Strings.  The Ganymede server tries
# to intern as many Strings as possible to reduce overall memory
# loading on the server's heap, but this requires that the JVM be told
# to increase the amount of space dedicated to the Permanent
# Generation memory zone.  If you receive an OutOfMemoryError while
# running the Ganymede server that complains of 'PermGen space', you
# need to increase this value.  Note that the directive that makes use
# of this variable below only works on Sun's HOTSPOT VM's.  The value
# should be expressed as a number followed by the letter 'm' for
# megabyte.  I.e., 'MAXPERMSPACE=128m'.

MAXPERMSPACE=128m

# These options control how frequently the Ganymede server will
# perform full heap GC to insure release of remote (client-side) RMI
# objects.  The Java 1.3 JDK defaults to doing full GC for RMI server
# apps once a minute, but the Ganymede server never releases
# references to clients or admin consoles unless the client or admin
# console quits/disconnects, in which case there's no need for the
# Ganymede server to tell the client/console that it can release
# objects.
#
# By setting the RMIGC control values to 3600000, we make the
# Ganymede server only perform mandatory full-heap GC once an
# hour, letting the lower impact generational garbage collection logic
# handle clean-up of transient objects

RMIGC='-Dsun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval=3600000 -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=3600000'

# Set a higher upper limit on the number of descriptors so that

# This may be Solaris-specific, so use with caution if you're on
# another operating system.

# Below this point we have a few choices of invocation lines that
# actually run your JVM on the Ganymede server..
#
# The minimum requirements to invoke the Ganymede server is to
# run the jvm on the arlut.csd.ganymede.server.Ganymede class file, with a
# command line parameter thereafter of usedirectory=$INSTALLDIR to give
# the Ganymede server access to its configuration/database files. 
#
# The optional -resetadmin parameter forces the Ganymede server
# to reset the root-privileged supergash and the monitor passwords
# from the properties file.  If you forget the supergash password, the
# only way you can change it is to edit the ganymede.properties file
# in the server install directory and set the ganymede.defaultrootpass
# property to what you want the new supergash password to be, and to
# include -resetadmin on the java invocation line so that the
# Ganymede server will reset its password.
#
# You'll want to see a line that looks like this:
#
# ganymede.defaultrootpass=myNewSekretPassword
#
# It is perfectly reasonable to remove this line from the
# ganymede.properties file once you have the server started with the
# password you want, but if you ever forget, putting this property
# back into the ganymede.properties file and specifying -resetadmin
# will let you reinitialize the supergash password.
#
# The optional -logrmi parameter causes the Ganymede
# server to log all RMI calls made to it, as well as any exceptions
# that are thrown in response to RMI calls.  If the server is throwing
# an exception in response to something someone does in a Ganymede client
# or with the admin console, the RMI debug log will capture the
# exception's stack trace.
#
# If you use -logrmi as a switch, the RMI log will be placed in
# $INSTALLDIR/debug.log.  If you want to specify a different path
# to the RMI log, you can use logrmi as an assignment on the command
# line, as in
#
#	logrmi=/var/log/ganymede/rmi.log
#
# or the like.
#
# The optional -forcelocalhost parameter will force the Ganymede server
# to ignore the fact that the configured hostname will
# map to the 127.0.0.1 loopback address.  If the Ganymede
# server prints an error message and refuses to start due to some
# problem relating to 127.0.0.1, adding -forcelocalhost to the java
# invocation line will tell the Ganymede server not to be so
# picky.  You'll then be able to use the Ganymede server from
# the local system, at least.  See the Ganymede FAQ for more
# details on this option.
#
# The optional -suppressEmail parameter will force the Ganymede
# server to *not* send any email notifications for any reason.
# Think of it as an email "master cutoff switch".
#
# The optional -nossl parameter will force the Ganymede server not
# to use SSL to protect client/server communications.  You should only
# use this if you are needing to do high-speed offline bulk loading,
# or the like.
#
# The optional telnet=<portnumber> parameter, if provided, causes the
# Ganymede server to open a Jython interpreter service on port
# <portnumber> which a Ganymede administrator with adequate
# privileges can telnet to.  The Jython interpreter only allows
# local logins, made from the local machine that is running the
# Ganymede server, to avoid allowing Ganymede account
# and password names from going over unprotected telnet.
#
# The -resetadmin, -forcelocalhost, -suppressEmail, telnet, and
# -logrmi or logrmi=XXX parameters should be placed on the invocation
# line after arlut.csd.ganymede.server.Ganymede.

# Other options included below include the -Xms32m and -Xmx256m jvm
# options, which force a minimum heap size of 32 megabytes and a
# maximum heap size of 256 megabytes.  If you are running an unusally
# large Ganymede installation, you may want to increase the
# maximum heap size to something greater than 256 megabytes.

#			     ----====----

# The following line runs with HotSpot JITTING on.  Any exceptions
# thrown by the server will not include line numbers, but the
# '-logrmi' option does cause RMI calls to the
# server to be logged to $INSTALLDIR/debug.log.
#
# The directive '-XX:MaxPermSize=$MAXPERMSPACE' is used to increase
# the portion of the server's heap that is dedicated to class and
# method memory, and most especially to interned string storage.  The
# Ganymede server aggressively interns Strings to avoid redundantly
# storing Strings in the heap.  This directive may not be recognized
# in JVMs other than Sun's.. you can remove this directive if you need
# to in such cases.
