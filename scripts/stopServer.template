# Ganymede stopServer Script
#
# Arguments: 
#
# stopServer [-delay]
#
# if -delay is provided on the command line, the stopServer script
# will do a deferred shutdown on the server.  This means that the
# server will not allow new users to log on, and will shut down
# as soon as all active users have logged out.
