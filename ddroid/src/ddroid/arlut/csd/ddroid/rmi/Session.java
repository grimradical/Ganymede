   Client side remote interface.

   Client side interface definition for the Directory Droid Session Object.  The
   Directory Droid Session object holds the state for a Directory Droid client's session
   with the Directory Droid server.  The Directory Droid session will also provide the
   primary interface for accessing ganymede db objects.
