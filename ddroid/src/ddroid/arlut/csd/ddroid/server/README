--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the Directory Droid server code.

The Ganymede.java class is the starting point for the server, and
contains the main() entry point.  The Ganymede class swiftly creates
and loads the DBStore and the DBStore journal, then creates the
GanymedeServer class which acts to process user and admin console
logins.  Logging and the background GanymedeScheduler is started, and
finally the GanymedeServer is bound and exposed through RMI.  At this
point, the server is ready to handle logins.

When logins occur, the GanymedeServer will create (and expose through
RMI) a GanymedeSession object for the user.  The client can then make
RMI calls to the GanymedeSession (using the Session interface defined
in the arlut.csd.ddroid.rmi package) to do queries, edit objects,
commit transactions, and so on.  GanymedeSession actually holds most
of the logic in the Directory Droid server.
