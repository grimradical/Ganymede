This directory contains RMI remote interface definitions for the
Ganymede server.  Clients and the admin console need access to
these interfaces so that they can talk to objects whose classes are
typically defined in the server directory.

The one exception here is the FileReceiver interface, which is also
(currently) implemented in the xmlclient so that the server can
transmit XML files to that program for the -dump operation.
