This is a sample ASCII version of a motd for the server.  It is stored
in <server install directory>/db/text/motd.txt.  It can and should be
modified by your Directory Droid administrator.  This text file can be
edited at any time.  If it has changed since the last time a Directory
Droid user has logged in, the primary GUI client will display this
file, assuming an html version of this file is not available.
