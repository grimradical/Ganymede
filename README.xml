Ganymede Release 1.0 prerelease beta 3
October 5, 2000
README.xml
---------------------------------------------

In this code drop, installClient will install an xmlclient, which is
capable of transmitting data in bulk into an installed Ganymede
server.  The xml file format used is documented in doc/xml.html.

The xmlclient itself has a command line option which is not
yet documented elsewhere.  This is the following:

  xmlclient -dumpschema

	This will cause the xmlclient to connect to the Ganymede server
	and to dump a <ganymede> xml file to stdout that includes a
	<ganyschema> section defining the current schema definition in
	the Ganymede server.

Otherwise, if you run xmlclient by itself on the command line, it will
present the command line options that it supports.
