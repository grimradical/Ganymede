Ganymede Release 1.0 prerelease beta 4
October 10, 2000

---------------------------------------------

In this code drop, installClient will install an xmlclient, which is
capable of transmitting data in bulk into an installed Ganymede
server.  The xml file format used is documented in doc/xml.html.

The xmlclient itself has a couple of command line options which are
not yet documented elsewhere.  This includes the following:

  xmlclient -dumpschema

	This will cause the xmlclient to connect to the Ganymede server
	and to dump a <ganymede> xml file to stdout that includes a
	<ganyschema> section defining the current schema definition in
	the Ganymede server.

  xmlclient -dumpdata

	This will cause the xmlclient to connect to the Ganymede server
	and to generate a complete dump to stdout in xml format
	of the Ganymede server's database, both schema and data.

  Both of these options require a supergash-level account name and
  password in order to work, and both cause the server to lock out
  new transactions from commiting for as long as they run.  It is not
  a good idea to do 'xmlclient -dumpdata | more' and walk away from
  it, as the server will block indefinitely in that situation.

Otherwise, if you run xmlclient by itself on the command line, it will
present the command line options that it supports for xml bulk edits.

In this distribution there is a sample perl script packaged with the
Linux schema kit which can process the Linux password, group, and
shadow files and produce an xml file compatible with the xmlclient
when using the Linux schema kit.  You may find this script,
src/schemas/linux/loader/linux2xml.pl, helpful in learning how to
generate xml content for the Ganymede server.
