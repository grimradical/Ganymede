hyper-links that link to extra information about many topics
discussed.  If you can, view this document with a web browser as

    <p>Upgrading Ganymede generally amounts to upgrading the <a
    href="glossary.html#ganymedeServer.jar">jar files</a> that contain
    the Java class files that make up the Ganymede server and clients.
    When a new release of Ganymede comes out, you'll generally want to
    upgrade your server and your clients together, as it is sometimes
    necessary to make incompatible changes to the network API's that
    the clients use to talk to the server between versions of the
    Ganymede distribution.</p>

    <p>Upgrading the clients is extremely easy, as there is almost
    never anything to be done other than to replace the <a
    href="glossary.html#ganymede.jar">client jar files</a>.  Sometimes
    the support files that are used to launch the clients may change,
    as is the case with the Ganymede 1.0.5 upgrade, which introduces
    support for Sun's <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">Java Web
    Start</a> application launcher.  At the worst, you can simply
    delete the old clients and re-install.  More on this later.</p>

    <p>The hardest thing to upgrade is the schema kit that takes care
    of backend network updates when transactions are committed in the
    Ganymede server.  Generally, the backend scripts that take files
    emitted by the Ganymede server and propagate them into your
    network are heavily customized for local use, and you will not
    want to lose that work.  We'll go into greater detail on this as
    well.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC">
	<td colspan="1"><h2><b>Upgrading the Ganymede Server</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
    </table> 

    <p>The first thing to do when upgrading the Ganymede server is to
    make a backup copy of your existing server installation.  Shut
    down your existing server, create a tar file of your existing
    server directory, and put it in a safe place.  You may also want
    to use the <a href="xml/xmlclient.html">xml client</a> to dump
    a copy of your current database to an XML file for safekeeping,
    just in case.<p>

    <p>Note that it's very important to shut down your existing server
    cleanly before performing an upgrade.  The database file format
    may change slightly between versions of the Ganymede server, and
    Ganymede's data loading routines currently take more care at
    handling version differences when reading the ganymede.db file
    than when reading the transaction journal.  Cleanly shutting down
    the server gives the server an opportunity to coalesce all
    transactions into the ganymede.db file, and will help avoid
    problems in the upgrade.</p>

    <p>Now, assuming you've done a clean shutdown of your old server
    and made backup copies of everything, you'll want to take the new
    Ganymede distribution and unpack it, <a
    href="glossary.html#configure">configure</a> it, and run <a
    href="glossary.html#installServer">installServer</a> to install
    the new server code into a scratch directory.</p>
      
    <p>Once you have installed the new server into a scratch
    directory, you can go ahead and copy the new <a
    href="glossary.html#ganymede.jar">ganymede.jar</a> and <a
    href="glossary.html#ganymedeServer.jar">ganymedeServer.jar</a>
    from the scratch directory's <code>jars</code> directory into your
    existing server's <code>jars</code> directory.</p>
    
    <p>That is generally all that you will have to do to upgrade your
    server.  The Ganymede server is designed to retain upward
    compatiblity with all of its data files, including especially the
    <a href="glossary.html#ganymede.db">ganymede.db</a> file.  Newer
    servers can load and use ganymede.db files from any version of
    Ganymede released in the last couple of years, but if you are
    upgrading from a very old release (before 0.99), you may have
    problems.  If worst comes to worst, we've got that backup copy of
    everything.</p>

    <p>The more typical problem you'll encounter is a compatibility
    problem between the schema kit you have installed and the new
    ganymedeServer.jar file.  The custom code in a <a
    href="glossary.html#custom.jar">custom.jar</a> file is meant to be
    compiled against the contents of a specific ganymedeServer.jar
    file, and it is good practice to recompile your custom code, just
      to be sure.</p>

    <p>Assuming that you are using a schema kit that is structured in
    the same way as the Ganymede 1.0 userKit, the way to do this is to
    cd to <code>&lt;server&gt;/schema/src</code> and run the
    <code>build</code> and <code>buildJar</code> scripts.  If the
    build and buildJar scripts compile and install your code without
    problems, you are probably done with the server upgrade.</p>

    <p>If not, take your backup copy and restore the original state of
    the <code>&lt;server&gt;</code> directory from your backup.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind during all of this that all of the server scripts
    are custom configured to run in the location in which they are
    installed.  If you try running your backup copy in a different
    location than it was originally installed, you'll find things not
    working properly.  The jar files don't care, obviously, but don't
    think that the server you installed in the scratch directory can
    be moved to where your old server was running.  If you want to
    completely reinstall from scratch, install the server where you
    want it from the beginning.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC">
	<td colspan="1"><h2><b>Upgrading the Schema Kit</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
    </table> 

    <p>It is possible, however, that your schema kit rebuild won't
    work properly.  This generally means that something in the server
    has changed in an incompatible fashion.  Since 1.0, I am trying to
    avoid this kind of incompatible change, but if it happens, it
    should be noted in the Ganymede distribution's CHANGES file.</p>

    <p>Alternately, it may be that your rebuild worked fine, but you
    have seen that a new version of the schema kit that you are using
    has been released, and you want to upgrade your schema kit,
    possibly even without upgrading the server proper.  This is a more
    tricky issue, as you will have customized a lot of the files in
    your server's schema directory in order to interconnect the files
    generated by Ganymede with your network.</p>

    <p>This discussion will be assuming that you are using a schema
    kit patterned after the Ganymede 1.0 userKit.  If you are using
    one of the pre-1.0 "schema kits", like we use at ARL:UT, or if you
    have designed your own custom code distribution without using the
    1.0 userKit as a template, you'll have to figure out how to do
    this process by analogy.</p>

    <p>Any schema kit upgrade you download should include a CHANGES
    file that will warn you of any things you'll need to look out for
    in doing the schema kit upgrade, as well as a description of what
    benefits you can expect to see from performing the upgrade.</p>

    <p>Before attempting to perform any schema kit upgrade, you will
    want to have shut down and backed up your entire server directory,
    as discussed above.  Once this is done, you should rename the
    <code>&lt;server&gt;/schema</code> directory to something like
    <code>&lt;server&gt;/schema.save</code>.</p>

    <p>Once the schema directory has been renamed, you can run the
    <code>installKit</code> script from the newly downloaded schemaKit
    distribution.  <code>installKit</code> will ask you for the name
    of the directory where your server is installed.  Tell it the
    location of your existing server directory, and
    <code>installKit</code> will compile all of the custom code in the
    new schema kit against your server's <a
    href="glossary.html#ganymedeServer.jar">ganymedeServer.jar</a>
    file, and integrate the new schema kit into your existing server
    directory, creating a new <code>schema</code> directory
    underneath your <code>&lt;server&gt;</code> directory, alongside
    your pre-existing <code>schema.save</code> directory.</p>

    <p>If the <code>installKit</code> script fails for some reason,
    you haven't lost anything.  You can just delete the
    <code>schema</code> directory it was trying to create and rename
    your <code>schema.save</code> directory back to
    <code>schema</code> to put the old schema kit back in place.</p>

    <p>Assuming it succeeds, though, you need to do the next step,
    which is to migrate your backend scripts forward.  In the simplest
    case, where you don't care about any improvements in whatever
    backend scripts are provided by the new schema kit, and the new
    schema kit's logic for interfacing with its build scripts has not
    changed, you can generally just replace the new schema kit's
    <code>output</code> directory with the <code>output</code>
    directory for your <code>schema.save</code> directory.  The
    Ganymede 1.0 userKit is designed so that all files and scripts
    involved with the backend update process are stored in the
    <code>&lt;server&gt;/schema/output</code> directory, so if you
    move your old <code>output</code> directory forward, you should
    keep everything on the backend working just as before.</p>

    <p>If the new schema kit includes new features in the backend,
    you'll probably want to either copy some of the scripts from the
    new kit's <code>output</code> directory, or at the very least look
    at the files and see if you need or want to make any manual edits
    to incorporate new features.  Again, read the CHANGES file in the
    new schema kit for details.</p>

    <p>Once you have completed this process, you can start your server
    up again, and all should be well.  If not, you've got that backup
    copy, and you can just recreate your <code>&lt;server&gt;</code>
    directory as it was before your attempted upgrade.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC">
	<td colspan="1"><h2><b>Upgrading the Ganymede Clients</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
    </table> 

    <p>Upgrading the clients is a lot easier than upgrading the
    server, but you will often need to do both at the same time.
    Upgrading the clients without upgrading the server may cause a
    failure of the clients, as they attempt to speak to the server
    using a newer version of the network API's than the server can
    handle.  If you upgrade the clients, you should plan on upgrading
    the server, and vice versa, generally.</p>

    <p>Again, before you do anything to your existing clients, you
    should make a backup copy of everything.  Upgrading the clients is
    easy, but if you find that your server upgrade fails, you will
    need to revert the clients as well as the server.</p>

    <p>The easiest way to upgrade the clients is to simply delete the
    old clients (scripts and jars and all) and re-run the <a
    href="glossary.html#installClient">installClient</a> and <a
    href="glossary.html#installWeb">installWeb</a> scripts from the
    new Ganymede distribution that you have downloaded.</p>

    <p>If you have made significant local customizations to the client
    scripts or web forms, you can do a more nuanced upgrade by just
    taking the new jar files and incorporating them into your existing
    client directories.</p>

    <p>In this case, all you need to do is to run <a
    href="glossary.html#installClient">installClient</a> or <a
    href="glossary.html#installWeb">installWeb</a> to get the new jar
    files installed into a scratch directory.  Copy <a
    href="glossary.html#ganymede.jar">ganymede.jar</a> and <a
    href="glossary.html#ganymedeAdmin.jar">ganymedeAdmin.jar</a> from
    the scratch directory to your old client directories, and you're
    set.</p>
