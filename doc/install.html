<p>Ganymede is a client-server system with three distinct components
that need to be installed in order to use it.  These parts are the
Ganymede server, the Ganymede client suite, and the schema kit.</p>

<p>The server acts as a central repository and control system, storing
your network directory information in its built-in object database and
updating various network services when changes are made.  The server
is designed to be installed on a UNIX system, and depends on Java and
Perl to carry out its internal and external operations.</p>

<p>The Ganymede client suite includes a variety of command-line, web,
and GUI clients that can connect to the Ganymede server over the
network.  The Ganymede distribution includes a script to install
these clients on UNIX systems, but most of the clients can be accessed
over the web from a PC or Macintosh with a suitable version of Java
installed.</p>

<p>A schema kit contains all the pieces needed to turn the raw
Ganymede engine into a custom-tailored database system shaped to fit a
particular application. A schema kit defines the kinds of data to be
held in the Ganymede server's database, custom logic to provide
intelligent management of that data, and external scripts that take
the data from the Ganymede server and integrate it into your network.
Assuming that you don't want to try and develop your own database
definition from scratch, you'll want to download a pre-built schema
kit for use with your Ganymede server.<p>

<p>The Ganymede distribution that you downloaded includes everything
you need to install the server and client suite, but does not include
a schema kit.  You will need to visit <a
href="ftp://ftp.arlut.utexas.edu/pub/ganymede/">ftp://ftp.arlut.utexas.edu/pub/ganymede/</a>
or one of the mirrors listed at <a
href="http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/gash2/Download.html">http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/gash2/Download.html</a>
in order to download a schema kit.</p>

<p>This document will cover the installation of Ganymede from start to
finish, using the 1.0 version of our newly developed userKit as an
example.  Any other schema kits that are developed will have some
differences, but will likely be installed and used in similar
ways.</p>

    </table> 

<p>The Ganymede system is designed to be easy to install for anyone
running a Unix or Linux system with Java, Perl, and Bourne Shell
installed.  Ganymede is designed to work with any version of Java
equal to or better than 1.1.7, but you will get very much better
performance if you use Java 1.2.2 or later for the Ganymede server.
Java 1.3 with the HotSpot server JVM will give you the best
performance, and is recommended.  You will need the full Java
Development Kit (JDK or SDK) on your UNIX server so that you can
compile any custom plug-in classes.</p>

<p>If you will be running the Ganymede clients on UNIX under the X
Window System, any version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.1
or better should work, but you will need to download and install the
Swing GUI libraries from Sun to make anything less than Java 1.2 work.
Java 1.3 will provide the best performance and fewest bugs in the
Swing libraries.  If you will happen to be using an X Window
environment with less than 8 bit color, however, you will have to
stick with Java 1.1.7 or Java 1.1.8 in order to run the clients.  Java
1.1.7 or 1.1.8 will also likely have better graphical performance if
you are using remote X Window displays.</p>

<p>To run the Ganymede clients in a web browser on a desktop PC
running some version of Windows 95/98/NT/2000/ME/etc., you will want
to download and install version 1.3 of the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) for Windows.  Version 1.3 of the Java Runtime Environment for
Windows includes support for the Java Plug-In, a code module that will
allow you to run Java 1.3 code inside Netscape, Internet Explorer, and
Mozilla.</p>

<p>You can download any current version of the Java platform for
Solaris, Linux, and Windows at <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>.
Versions of Java for a number of other platforms may be found at <a
href="http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/java-ports.cgi">http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/java-ports.cgi</a>.
The Ganymede server has primarily been developed and tested on Solaris
and Linux, but the Ganymede clients have been successfully run on
Solaris, Linux, Windows 95, Windows NT, MacOS 9, OS/2, FreeBSD, AIX,
HP/UX, and others.</p>

<p>In addition to Java, you will need /bin/sh and Perl 5.003 (or
later) to run the Ganymede installation scripts.  The Ganymede
distribution, server and client, is designed to be unpacked and
installed on a UNIX system with support for symbolic links.  There is
no installer provided for Windows or Macintosh.  Instead, you have to
install the clients on the UNIX system and then use a web server to
publish the clients to your network.</p>

<p>By default, Java's security model will not allow a downloaded
applet to establish a network connection to any system other than the
one it was downloaded from, so you will need to install Apache or
another web server on the same machine on which you will be running
the Ganymede server.  You should probably go ahead and install the
Ganymede server and Apache on a dedicated machine rather than
installing the Ganymede server on your existing web server machine,
if you are worried about performance.</p>

<p>Note that Ganymede will not work through most firewall
configurations, as the RMI protocol involves communications on a
number of high port numbers that are chosen and assigned at runtime.
In addition, as mentioned in the FAQ, Ganymede 1.0 does not encrypt
its client/server communications.  This is something that we are
planning on adding for Ganymede 1.1, which will require Java 1.2 or
1.3 to run everything.  For now, however, you should plan on keeping
Ganymede safely behind a firewall.  We have had success at running the
Ganymede client on both the Cisco and Nortel VPN's.  If you find
yourself in that situation, send mail to the Ganymede mailing list at
<a
href="mailto:ganymede@arlut.utexas.edu">ganymede@arlut.utexas.edu</a>
and ask for the details.</p>

      </tr>
    </table> 

<p>The Ganymede distribution comes packaged with all of the Java
classes for the server and clients pre-compiled and packaged up into
jar files (located under the <b>jars/</b> directory in the distribution
directory).  It is not necessary to compile anything in order to
install the Ganymede server and clients, but you do have to run the <a
href="glossary.html#configure">configure</a> script in the
distribution directory in order to prepare the distribution for
installation.  The <a href="glossary.html#configure">configure</a>
script is a custom-written Bourne shell script which searches around
on your system to find Perl 5 and Java, and then uses that information
to bootstrap the rest of the installation process.</p>

<p>When you run <a href="glossary.html#configure">configure</a>, it
will copy a few scripts from the <b>scripts/</b> directory into the
top-level distribution directory, editing them to set the proper
location for the Perl interpreter on your system, and otherwise
setting everything up for you to proceed with installation.  These
scripts are <a href="glossary.html#installClient">installClient</a>,
<a href="glossary.html#installWeb">installWeb</a> and <a
href="glossary.html#installServer">installServer</a>.  You will use
these scripts to install the command-line UNIX clients, the web applet
clients, and the server itself, respectively.</p>
    
<p>In addition, the <a href="glossary.html#configure">configure</a>
script goes through the <b>src</b> directory and sets up scripts that
can be used to compile the Ganymede sources.  Generally speaking, you
should not need to do this, as everything is precompiled in the
<b>jars</b> directory, but if you want to hack on the Ganymede server
or clients, <a href="glossary.html#configure">configure</a> sets
everything up so you can.  See the README.source file in the top-level
distribution directory for information on building the source tree if
you want to investigate the source code.</p>

	<td colspan="1"><h2><b>3. Installing the Server</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
    </table> 

<p>Installing the Ganymede server is the next thing to be done after
you have unpacked and configured the distribution.  You should plan on
installing the Ganymede server on a system that has Java and Perl
installed, and which has a web server available to provide downloads
of the Ganymede client applets for your users who will be accessing
Ganymede through a web browser.</p>

<p>The <a href="glossary.html#installServer">installServer</a> script
produced in the distribution directory by the <a
href="glossary.html#configure">configure</a> script will ask you a
series of questions, then install the Ganymede server in its own
directory.</p>

<p>These questions include the following:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Where are the jdk binaries located?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>This is just asking for the directory that contains your
	system's java binaries.  The configure script will attempt to
	provide a reasonable default for this question, but you may
	have to correct it if you have more than one version of java
	installed on your system and it chooses wrong.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Where should the server tree be installed?</b></dt>
<dd>
      <p>This question is asking where you want to install the server
      at in your UNIX system's filesystem.  The Ganymede server tree
      should not be installed in a location that is accessible to the
      average user, as all of your directory data is held in this
      directory tree.  There is no default answer for this question,
      so you will have to pick a location.  You can use either
      absolute or relative directory names here.</p>

      <p>Note that when you install the server, the <a
      href="glossary.html#installServer">installServer</a> script
      customizes the server installation with the paths where you have
      installed the server.  If you ever decide to move the server in
      your filesystem, you will need to create a symlink at the old
      location to allow the old paths to resolve properly, or you will
      need to go through the various scripts and files and make sure
      that any reference to the old path has been updated.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>What is the name of the system that the server will run on?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>This information is used by the <a
	href="glossary.html#stopServer">stopServer</a> and <a
	href="glossary.html#xmlclient">xmlclient</a> clients that are
	installed into the server tree.  This may be an I.P. address
	or a fully qualified DNS host name.  The installServer script
	will provide the name of the system you are on as a
	default.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>What port should the RMI registry supporting Ganymede run on?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>The RMI registry is a network lookup service that is used
	by the Ganymede clients to establish communications with the
	Ganymede server.  By default, port number 1099 is used. If you
	are running certain other Java services, you may already have
	an RMI registry running, in which case you should pick another
	port number to run the Ganymede registry on.  You may want to
	use 1100, 1101, or another non-used tcp port.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>What mailhost should Ganymede use to send out diagnostic mail?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>The Ganymede server is able to send out email in response
	to a variety of system events.  If the UNIX system you are
	installing Ganymede on is able to send mail, you are probably
	okay with the default.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>What email address should Ganymede sign on email that it sends out?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>This question is asking you what Ganymede should put in the
	'From:' field of mail that it sends out in response to system
	events.  In many configurations, the Ganymede server will send
	out mail using the name of the user whose action triggered
	mail, but for things like system shutdown/restart, etc. it
	needs an email address to go by.  If this email address is not
	valid, users who reply to system event mail from Ganymede will
	have their replies bounce.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>What name do you want the Ganymede superuser account to have?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>The default 'supergash' name is probably okay here, but you
	can change it if you want.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>What password do you want the superuser account to have?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>This password provides complete access to the Ganymede
	server's database, and is necessary for a variety of system
	operations.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>What name do you want the Ganymede monitor account to have?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>The monitor account has no privileges to do anything at all
	to other than to login with the Ganymede admin console and
	view the server's activity log.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>What password do you want the monitor account to have?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>This password provides the right to watch the server's
	activities using the admin console, but provides no permission
	to log into the server and view or edit any data.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Once you answer all these questions, the installServer script will
proceed to install the Ganymede server in the location specified.</p>

<p>Once installed, you will have a server directory that contains a
number of directories, some documentation files, and a <a
href="glossary.html#server.properties">ganymede.properties</a> file
that the Ganymede server executables use as a configuration
resource.</p>

<p>The <b>bin/</b> directory contains:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a>, which actually runs the server</li>
      <li><a href="glossary.html#stopServer">stopServer</a>, a script that can
	be used to cleanly shut the server down.</li>
      <li><a href="glossary.html#xmlclient">xmlclient</a>, a script that is
	used to load XML-formatted data into the Ganymede server.</li>
      <li><a href="glossary.html#logscan">logscan.pl</a>, a script that is
	used by the server to accelerate searches through the Ganymede <a href="glossary.html#log">log</a>
	file.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The <b>db/</b> directory contains:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="glossary.html#ganymede.db">ganymede.db</a>
      file, which contains all data objects and schema definitions
      held by the Ganymede server.</li>
      <li>A running <a href="glossary.html#journal">journal</a> file
      that records all transactions made by the server so that the
      server can fully recover if it ever crashes or if the system
      running it goes down.</li>
      <li>A comprehensive <a href="glossary.html#log">log</a> file,
      which documents all changes made to the database.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The <b>jars/</b> directory contains the compiled java classes that
actually comprise the Ganymede server and the Java-based <a
href="glossary.html#stopServer">stopServer</a> and <a
href="glossary.html#xmlclient">xmlclient</a> clients.</p>

<p>The <b>doc/</b> directory contains copies of all of the Ganymede
documentation.</p>

<p>The <b>backups/</b> directory is used by certain schema kits to
store backup copies of any networking files written out by the schema
kit's builder tasks.  These back up copies will be written into
subdirectories that are named by date, and which will be automatically
zipped up once a day.  Nothing in this directory is used by the
Ganymede server for any purpose other than your peace of mind in case
you have a problem with the Ganymede server and need to get back an
old copy of a passwd or nis file in a pinch.  If you don't want to
spend the disk space on archival copies of your network data files,
just edit the <a
href="glossary.html#server.properties">ganymede.properties</a> file
and comment out the 'ganymede.builder.backups' property.</p>

      </tr>
    </table> 

<p>Once you have the server installed, you can proceed to install a
schema kit, which will customize and configure the server for your
requirements.</p>

<p>When you download and unpack a schema kit, you should find
documentation that will walk you through the installation process.
Essentially it comes down to running a <b>installKit</b> script,
which will ask you where you installed your server and where Java
is, and will then create a <b>schema</b> directory under your server
directory.  This directory should include:</p>

<ul>
      <li>a <b>custom.jar</b> file that includes the Java classes to be
      added to your server by the schema kit</li>

      <li>a <b>src/</b> directory that contains all of the Java source
      code that was compiled into the <a
      href="glossary.html#custom.jar">custom.jar</a> file.</li>

      <li>a <b>scripts/</b> directory, that contains various Perl
      scripts used by the schema kit.</li>

      <li>an <b>output/</b> directory that contains any networking
      files that are written out by the Ganymede server when
      transactions are committed, as well as the scripts that are run
      to handle external actions when those transactions are
      committed.</li>

      <li>and finally, you will probably see some kind of loader
      script that can import data from your existing environment and
      generate an <a href="xml.html">XML file</a> for use with the <a
      href="glossary.html#xmlclient">xmlclient</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important part at this point is the <a
href="glossary.html#custom.jar">custom.jar</a> file.  Once that file
is in place, you can proceed to run the Ganymede server, which will
then start up and find the extra classes needed to run the server with your
schema kit.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC">
	<td colspan="1"><h2><b>5. Running the Ganymede Server</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
    </table> 

<p>Once you have installed your schema kit, you can go ahead and run
the server.  You do this by running the <a
href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a> script in the server's
<b>bin/</b> directory.  <a
href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a> starts up the rmiregistry
on the port you indicated when running <b>installServer</b>, then runs
the Ganymede server itself.</p>

<p>The Ganymede server is a pure Java application, so when you run
it, you are really running your platform's java execution environment
(which may be an interpreter, a JIT compiler, or an advanced hybrid).  Java
doesn't provide a lot of access to operating-system level functionality,
so the Ganymede server doesn't know how to detach itself from your terminal
window or console, and it doesn't know how to respond gracefully to
kill signals.</p>

<p>Because of these reasons, we suggest you run the Ganymede server in
a fashion similar to this:</p>

<pre>
      server% bin/runServer >& server.log &
</pre>

<p>if you are running csh or tcsh, or</p>

<pre>
      bash$ runServer > server.log 2>&1 &
</pre>

<p>if you are running sh or bash.</p>

<p>In either case, you want to capture all stdout and stderr output
from the server into a log file.  The Ganymede server will print out
status and error messages as it runs, and you really want to capture
this information.</p>

<p>You can view the server's log as the server runs with the
<code>tail</code> command, using the <code>-f</code> option, as
follows:</p>

<pre>
      server% tail -f server.log
</pre>

<p>That way, if your window is killed or you absent-mindedly hit
ctrl-c, you will only kill off the <code>tail</code> command.  You
want the server itself to run in the background, undisturbed.</p>

<p>The <b>installServer</b> script is smart enough to try and identify
the version of Java you are running, and to install a version of
<a href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a> that matches.  If you
look at <a href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a>, however,
you will see that there are a number of optional command line
parameters you can provide to tweak the Ganymede server's behavior.</p>

<p>Of particular interest in this regard are the
<code>-resetadmin</code> and the <code>debug=xxx</code> parameters.
These are both documented in the <a
href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a> script itself, but it is
worth discussing them here.  The <code>-resetadmin</code> parameter
causes the Ganymede server to reset the administrative 'supergash'
password in the system to the value defined in the server's <a
href="glossary.html#server.properties">ganymede.properties</a> file.
It is reasonable to remove the 'ganymede.defaultrootpass' property
from the <a
href="glossary.html#server.properties">ganymede.properties</a> file if
you don't want to leave your Ganymede 'root' password lying around in
plaintext, but if you ever forget the password, you'll want to keep
the <code>-resetadmin</code> parameter option in mind.  You should not
remove the ganymede.defaultrootpass property until the server has
successfully started up and created its <a
href="glossary.html#ganymede.db">ganymede.db</a> file, however.</p>

<p>If the <code>debug=xxx</code> parameter is used, the Ganymede
server will log all network calls made by clients to a debug log file
of your choice.  This may degrade performance very slightly, but it
will provide an invaluable trace and exception log if the server ever
hangs or crashes.  Unless you know you will never need to worry about
the possibility of exceptions in the server, I'd recommend you leave
the <code>debug=xxx</code> parameter as you find it.  The
<b>installServer</b> script will install the <a
href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a> script with the debug
option set to generate a <b>debug.log</b> file in your server's
top-level directory.</p>

<p>While the server is running, you should see two separate Java
processes running, one for the rmiregistry, and one for the Ganymede
server.  If you are running the Ganymede server on a Linux system, you
may see what looks like a very large number of Java processes running.
This is perfectly normal.  In current versions of Linux, the
<code>ps</code> and <code>top</code> commands will show you a separate
entry for each thread that is running in a given process.  Both the
rmiregistry and the Ganymede server are heavily multithreaded, so you
should expect to see dozens of Java threads running on a Linux
system.</p>

<p>When you want to shut the server down, you'll just need to order it
to shut down from the Ganymede admin console (which we'll talk about
below), or by using the <a
href="glossary.html#stopServer">stopServer</a> script in the server's
<b>bin/</b> directory.  Either one will transmit to the server a
shutdown message, which will result in the server kicking any active
users off the system, consolidating its database to disk, and finally
shutting down.  The Ganymede server is designed to recover smoothly on
restart if it is killed or if the system crashes or is rebooted at any
point during its execution, but the server might spend a bit of time
on clean up work on start up in such cases.</p>

<p>Shutting down the server won't automatically stop the rmiregistry
process, so you will have to do a bit of manual cleanup to get rid of
it if it bothers you to leave it running.  Otherwise, the Ganymede
server will re-attach to the rmiregistry when you restart the server,
but you'll see an exception message displayed when the <a
href="glossary.html#runServer">runServer</a> tries and fails to start
a new rmiregistry process on the same port.</p>

<p>If you know that you don't want to start the server back up again,
it is perfectly fine to go ahead and use the Unix <code>kill</code>
command to kill off the rmiregistry process.  Just be careful you've
got the one on the right port, or else you might cause problems for
any other Java services that are running on your system.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC">
	<td colspan="1"><h2><b>6. Loading Data Into the Server</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
    </table> 

<p>Now you have installed the server, integrated a schema kit into the
server directory, and started the server running.  You can now proceed
to use the schema kit to load data into the server.</p>

<p>When you first run the Ganymede server, the server will look in its
<b>db/</b> directory for its <a
href="glossary.html#ganymede.db">ganymede.db</a> file.  When it
doesn't find it, it will initialize itself with its default database
configuration.  The Ganymede server will only know about those objects
and fields that it uses for its own operations.  Before the Ganymede
server can handle the data for your network's directories, you will
need to define your custom object and field types in the Ganymede
server.</p>

<p>The Ganymede admin console has an 'Edit Schema' menu item which you
can use to bring up a graphical schema editor.  With the schema
editor, you can define new object types and define fields within the
object types.  Designing and implementing a new schema definition is a
bit involved, and is beyond the scope of this installation guide.</p>

<p>Fortunately for you, though, you're using a schema kit, so we
will just let it do that work.  For the rest of this discussion,
we'll pretend you have downloaded and installed a schema kit that
is almost entirely not unlike the <b>userKit</b> schema kit that
we are releasing with Ganymede 1.0.  If you are not using that
schema kit, you'll have to improvise along the same lines.</p>

<p>If you look in the <b>schema/</b> directory that the schema kit's
<b>installKit</b> script placed in your server directory, you will see
a <b>loader.pl</b> script and a <b>schema.xml</b> file.  The
<b>loader.pl</b> script is designed to take the database definition
information contained in the <b>schema.xml</b> file and combine it
with your data to create a <b>data.xml</b> file that you can then load
into the Ganymede server.</p>

<p>Actually running the <b>loader.pl</b> script should be relatively
straight forward, but you will want to consult the schema kit's
documentation for information on what sort of data it can import, what
configuration options the schema kit's plug-in logic classes support,
and the full details on integrating Ganymede and that schema kit
into your environment.</p>

<p>For now, we'll just assume that <b>loader.pl</b> has produced a
<b>data.xml</b> file that is formatted according to the <a
href="xml.html">Ganymede XML File Format Guide</a>.  Now all you need
to do is cd to your server's top-level directory and run</p>

<pre>
      server% bin/xmlclient schema/data.xml
</pre>

<p>This will cause the <a href="glossary.html#xmlclient">xmlclient</a>
to log into the server and upload both the schema kit's schema
definition and your data to the server.  <a
href="glossary.html#xmlclient">xmlclient</a> will produce some output
while it runs, but it is designed for speed over interactivity, and so
it may go quiet for long periods of time while it waits for the server
to chew through the XML that it has submitted.  If you like, you can
run the Ganymede admin console before starting <a
href="glossary.html#xmlclient">xmlclient</a> and actually watch as the
<a href="glossary.html#xmlclient">xmlclient</a> talks to the server
and creates all your objects in the database.</p>

<p>If all goes well, you should expect to see a bunch of messages
about it editing the server's schema and then creating a bunch of
objects from your data.  If something goes amiss, you should see some
information telling you where in the xml data stream it found
something that it didn't like.  With luck, a little hand-editing of
the <b>data.xml</b> file will let you put things right and try
again.</p>

<p>There is quite a lot more to say about how the schema kits are
constructed and how they operate, but this isn't the place for it.
Check in the schema kit for documentation on operations with the
schema kit.  For now, be aware that the <b>data.xml</b> file generated
by the userKit's <b>loader.pl</b> script is designed to initialize the
Ganymede database from scratch, and not to import new data to a server
that has already been up and running with data for awhile.  For the
full story on how to write XML files to do data editing in the
Ganymede server, see the <a href="xml.html">xml.html</a> file in the
<b>doc/</b> directory.</p>

    </table> 
    
    <p>There are two primary clients for Ganymede.  We will call these
    the end-user client and the admin console.  Both can be run from a
    UNIX command line with a shell script that will run java on them,
    or from a web browser with support for the full 1.1 JDK standard.
    There is nothing to stop you from running either client on a Win32
    box, but if you want to run the Ganymede clients on a Windows
    system outside of the context of a web browser, you will have to
    develop .bat files to run the code on your own.  The clients are
    themselves totally portable, however, as they are simply Java jar
    files.</p>
    
    <p>We have provided an install script for installing the Ganymede
    clients on a UNIX system.  <a
    href="glossary.html#installClient">installClient</a> will prompt you for the name
    of the machine that will be running your Ganymede server, and the
    directory which will contain the bin, html, and jars
    directories. The install script will then customize and install
    scripts for you so that the end-user client and admin console can
    easily be run.</p>

    <p>Don't try to install the client and server into the same
    directory.. the two are meant to be installed separately, in separate
    directories. This is important because the server files need to
    be kept out of the reach of non-privileged users, while the client
    files are intended to be available for anyone to run.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC">
	<td colspan="1"><h2><b>8. Prepare web access clients</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
    </table> 
    
    <p>The <a href="glossary.html#installWeb">installWeb</a> script is
    used to install, on your UNIX system, the html, cgi, and java
    files needed to support client access to Ganymede from a web
    browser.  When you run <a
    href="glossary.html#installWeb">installWeb</a>, it will ask you a
    small number of questions, including the following:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>What is the name of the system that the server will run on?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>This question is used to configure the applet launch page
	that your users will access to run the Ganymede applets.  This
	should be the name of the system on which you are going to run
	the Ganymede server.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>What port is the RMI registry supporting Ganymede running on?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>As with installClient and installServer, this is asking you
	for the port number for the Ganymede server's rmiregistry.
	This number must match the one used when you installed the
	server.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Where should the web access files be installed?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>This is asking for the name of a directory in which to
	install the web access files.  If this directory does not
	exist, it will be created in the directory containing it.
	This directory will need to be mappable to a url by a web
	server running on the same machine that will be running your
	Ganymede server.</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Where will the ganymede client binaries be installed?</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>This is asking for the directory that contains (or will
	contain) the Ganymede text mode clients, in particular <a
	href="glossary.html#xmlclient">xmlclient</a>.  The directory
	containing <a href="glossary.html#xmlclient">xmlclient</a>
	must be accessible by the user account that your web server
	runs under, so that the <a
	href="glossary.html#ganypass">ganypass.pl</a> CGI script can
	properly communicate with the Ganymede server.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

    <p><a href="glossary.html#installWeb">installWeb</a> will
    configure and install a bunch of files into a designated
    directory, including an index.html file, a couple of jar files
    containing the classes for the Ganymede gui client and admin
    console, a CGI script that will allow your users to change their
    passwords through their web browser using an HTML file, and
    various support files.  These files are customized during
    installation to point to the proper location for your Ganymede
    server.</p>

    <p>In order for your users to run the Ganymede client applets in
    their web browsers, you will have to install and configure a web
    server on the same machine that you will be running the Ganymede
    server.  The reason for this requirement is that Java applets are
    run in a security "sandbox", which puts security restrictions on
    downloaded code.  One of these restrictions is that unsigned
    applets are only allowed to open networking connections to the
    same machine that the applet was downloaded from.</p>

    <p>Because of this, you will have to install a web server on the
    same machine as your Ganymede server, and you will have to
    configure your web server so that your users can access the web
    client directory through the web server.  You should set up an
    alias in your httpd.conf file that maps a URL path like
    "/ganymede" to your web client directory.  This directory should
    be configured to allow running CGI scripts with the extension
    '.pl', to support the password change CGI script that is installed
    in that directory.</p>

    <p>Once the web server has been configured and the web clients
    installed, your users will be able to access your web client
    directory to run the Ganymede applet launcher (through the
    index.html file), or to run the Ganymede password change CGI
    script, <a href="glossary.html#ganypass">ganypass.pl</a>.  The <a
    href="glossary.html#ganypass">ganypass.pl</a> script is useful
    because it allows any web browser that supports HTML forms to be
    used to change a user's password, whereas the full Ganymede client
    launcher requires both JavaScript and Java support.</p>

    <p>If you do want your users to be able to run the full Ganymede
    client, you will need to be sure that their web browsers are
    configured properly.  The installed web files include versions of
    the Ganymede client pages designed for use with the Java plug-in
    on Windows (version 1.3.0 or better is really best.. see <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">java.sun.com/j2se</a> to download
    the Java plug-in), as well as a version of the client pages
    designed for use with a browser with built-in RMI and Swing
    support.  The 'native' option is intended for users of web
    browsers that have built-in support for Sun's latest JVM plug-ins.
    This includes the Netscape browser under OS/2, the Internet
    Explorer browser on Macintosh, and the Mozilla/Netscape 6 browser
    on Macintosh, Windows, Linux, and Solaris.</p>

    <p>On the Macintosh with Internet Explorer, you need to install
    the very latest version of Apple's <a
    href="http://www.apple.com/java/">Macintosh Runtime for Java</a>.
    Current version of the MRJ for traditional MacOS are based on Java
    1.1, and do not include the Swing class libraries required by the
    Ganymede clients.  In order to make Ganymede work on such systems,
    you will need to extract the swingall.jar file from Sun's JDK and
    install it on your Macintosh in a directory of your choosing.
    Internet Explorer has a preferences option to add additional class
    paths to your browser's Java environment.  Find and add the
    swingall.jar file to your Internet Explorer Java class list and
    you should be ready to go, using the native mode client.</p>

    <p>Windows users using Netscape 4.x or any version of Internet
    Explorer, will need to use the plug-in mode client.  If your users
    do not install the Java plug-in before trying to run the Plug-In
    clients, their web browser will help them download the Plug-In as
    needed.  Once the Java Plug-In is downloaded, the user will need
    to quit out of the browser and run the Plug-In control panel.
    Configure the Plug-In so that the network and class access is
    unrestricted and unsigned applets are allowed.  Apply the
    preference changes, and restart the browser.  The Ganymede Plug-In
    clients should work properly now.</p>

    <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: whenever you run applets using the Java
    Plug-In, the applets can only run as long as the log-in applet is
    still displayed in the web browser.  If you close the main browser
    window or click to a different page (either by following a link or
    by clicking back on the browser), the applet will be shut down.
    Both the Ganymede client and admin console have been written so
    that this shut-down is handled in an orderly fashion, but the
    shut-down is unavoidable, so be sure not to disturb the applet
    frame while you are using the client or console.</p>
