    <hr>

<p>The DBEditObject class is the Ganymede class that oversees
everything having to do with the editing of a particular type of
object held in the Ganymede object store.  Each type of object defined
in the schema editor can have its own custom class written to manage a
wide variety of activities involving objects of that type.  This list
includes the following activites:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Initialization of newly created objects</li>

    <li>Approving object linking and unlinking by users that don't have permission to
        edit an object of the managed type directly</li>
    <li>Extending the Ganymede permission model to take into account the actual contents
        of an object of the managed type for special purposes</li>
    <li>Validating objects of this type for completeness and consistency at transaction
        commit time</li>
    <li>Specifying what fields must be filled out before objects of this type
        can be committed</li>
    <li>Specifying whether this object type supports inactivation/reactivation and cloning</li>
    <li>Generating custom labels based on the contents of this or other objects</li>
    <li>Overseeing all operations on fields contained in the object, including
        the ability to refuse any operation on any field, the ability to make changes
        in other objects in response to operations on fields, the ability to
        cause the client to refresh other portions of its display to reflect
        effects that a change may have had on other objects and fields, and the
        ability to create wizard dialogs to walk the user through the ramifications
        of making certain kinds of changes to contained fields</li>
    <li>Controlling whether or not string and invid (object reference) fields have a list
        of predefined choices provided, and generating that list if the default choices
        are not appropriate.  By default, the server will handle providing a list of available
        choices for invid fields that are configured to point to objects of a certain type.</li>
    <li>Controlling certain constraints on acceptable values for contained fields, including
        whether an IP field can accept IPv6 addresses, whether a date field is limited to
        a certain range, and the like.</li>
    <li>Overseeing the transaction commit logic for transactions involving objects of this 
        type.  Custom DBEditObject subclasses can be written to transmit changes to an object
        of the managed type to external databases or files.  The Ganymede server supports
        a two phase commit protocol to allow changes to be propagated to external databases
        in a transaction-safe manner.</li>
    <li>Customization of how remote objects are labeled when presented in contained invid 
        fields.</li>
    <li>Custom creation logic for new embedded objects.</li>    
    </ol>

<p>All of these functions are documented in the Javadocs for the DBEditObject class, and you
can view the source code for arlut.csd.ganymede.DBEditObject in the schemas/base_classes
directory that is present when you un-tar the Ganymede distribution.  We will be documenting
things further in later releases.</p>
