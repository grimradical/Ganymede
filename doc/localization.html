   <h2>Introduction</h2>

   <p>Ganymede 2.0 is intended to give as much flexibility as possible
   to adopters who want to put it into operation.  A crucial part of
   this flexibility, for an international audience, is to support
   translation of buttons, menus, and server messages into languages
   other than English.</p>

   <p>Obviously, it would be a terrible burden to have to search
   through all of the Ganymede .java source files, looking for text
   strings to translate.  No one would want to translate the Ganymede
   software if it meant that they were then obliged to maintain their
   own translated version of Ganymede.</p>

   <p>To solve this problem, Ganymede takes advantage of the
   localization support built into the Java platform.  All message
   strings are read from Java property files, and all Strings, Dates,
   and Numbers are formatted with the Java MessageFormat Class.</p>

   <p>Translators can translate Ganymede to languages other than
   English by creating language-specific versions of these property
   files.  If the Ganymede software is run on a Java Runtime
   Environment that is configured to use a non-English language, the
   Java environment will automatically look for and use the
   appropriate versions of these property files.  If no appropriate
   translation exists, Ganymede reverts to using the default English
   message strings.</p>

   <p>In this document, we will discuss how you go about translating
   Ganymede to new languages, as well as how to take advantage of the
   support code in the Ganymede system to ensure that new code that
   you write in the Ganymede system will be easily translatable by
   someone else.</p>

   <h2>Translating Ganymede Messages</h2>

   <p>The default message files are named after the classes they are
   serving.  For instance, the message strings for the client's
   central class, <code>arlut.csd.ganymede.client.gclient</code>, is
   held in
   <code>src/resources/arlut/csd/ganymede/client/gclient.properties</code>.</p>

   <p>German language message strings are held in files named after
   the class, followed by an underscore and the ISO language code for
   German.  So the German version of the gclient message file is
   called <code>src/resources/arlut/csd/ganymede/client/gclient_de.properties</code>.</p>

   <p>By extension, a French language message file would be
   gclient_fr.properties, a Norwegian version would be
   gclient_no.properties, etc.</p>

   <p>You can find a complete list of these language codes at
   <a href="http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt">http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt</a>.</p>

   <p>To support adopters writing their own translations, Ganymede's
   ant build script, <code>src/build.xml</code>, includes special
   support for validating all message files against the Ganymede
   source code.</p>

   <p>If you run <code>ant validate</code>, a Perl script will be run
   which will analyze all message files and cross-check them against
   the Ganymede sources.  <code>ant validate</code> will print out a
   report letting you know how complete your translation is, and
   whether it is properly constructed.</p>

   <p>If you do generate a new translation for Ganymede, we encourage
   you to send us patches at ganymede_author@arlut.utexas.edu for us
   to incorporate into the master Ganymede repository.</p>

   <h2>Writing New Code to be Translatable</h2>

   <p>The Ganymede source tree uses a class named <a
   href="javadoc/arlut/csd/Util/TranslationService.html">arlut.csd.Util.TranslationService</a>
   pervasively to handle translation for all text message strings in
   the server, client, and admin console.</p>
 
   <p>This class must be used in conjunction with a particular usage
   convention in order to support automatic validation of message
   files with the 'ant validate' task in the Ganymede build.xml file.</p>
 
   <p>That convention is that every class that needs language
   translation services must declare a static final TranslationService
   object named 'ts' which is initialized with the fully qualified
   name of the class to which it belongs.</p>

   <p>All of your translatable code should include a declaration for
   'ts' that looks like this:</p>

<pre>
  /**
   * TranslationService object for handling string localization in
   * the Ganymede server.
   */

  static final TranslationService ts = TranslationService.getTranslationService("arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeXMLSession");
</pre>

   <p>With 'arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeXMLSession' replaced
   with the fully qualified name of your class.</p>
 
   <p>Actual translation calls should all be in the form of
   ts.l("messageName"), possibly with extra parameters, such as
   ts.l("messageName", arg1, arg2), and so forth.  The 'l' method of
   TranslationService is designed to be as compact as possible so that
   it can be used wherever you would normally use a string.  It
   returns a String formatted according to whatever language-sensitive
   property files are defined in Ganymede's src/resources
   directory.</p>
 
   <p>If you follow these conventions, the 'ant validate' task will be
   able to automatically analyze your code and cross reference it
   against the message property files under src/resources.  'ant
   validate' will warn you if you are missing messages, or if the
   messages are malformed, or if the messages specify a different
   number of parameters than the source code which uses the messages
   is expecting.</p>
 
   <p>So, for use within Ganymede, please be sure always to follow
   these conventions in your code.</p>
