   <h2>Introduction</h2>

   <p>Ganymede 2.0 is intended to give as much flexibility as possible
   to adopters who want to put it into operation.  A crucial part of
   this flexibility, for an international audience, is to support
   translation of buttons, menus, and server messages into languages
   other than English.</p>

   <p>Obviously, it would be a terrible burden to have to search
   through all of the Ganymede .java source files, looking for text
   strings to translate.  No one would want to translate the Ganymede
   software if it meant that they were then obliged to maintain their
   own translated version of Ganymede.</p>

   <p>To solve this problem, Ganymede takes advantage of the
   localization support built into the Java platform.  All message
   strings are read from Java property files, and all Strings, Dates,
   and Numbers are formatted with the Java MessageFormat Class.</p>

   <p>Translators can translate Ganymede to languages other than
   English by creating language-specific versions of these property
   files.  If the Ganymede software is run on a Java Runtime
   Environment that is configured to use a non-English language, the
   Java environment will automatically look for and use the
   appropriate versions of these property files.  If no appropriate
   translation exists, Ganymede reverts to using the default English
   message strings.</p>

   <p>In this document, we will discuss how you go about translating
   Ganymede to new languages, as well as how to take advantage of the
   support code in the Ganymede system to ensure that new code that
   you write in the Ganymede system will be easily translatable by
   someone else.</p>
