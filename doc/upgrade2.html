    <h2>Welcome to Ganymede 2.0</h2>

    <p>While Ganymede 2.0 is more similar to Ganymede 1.0 than it is
    different, the 2.0 series is the product of nearly ten years of
    development and refinement, and essentially every facet of the
    product has been refined, polished to a high shine, or at least
    tweaked, relative to the Ganymede 1.0 releases.</p>

    <p>The major functional differences between the Ganymede 1.0
    series and Ganymede 2.0 are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The entire source code tree has been refactored for clarity,
      and the build system is now based on Ant.</li>

      <li>Ganymede now requires Java 6 (JDK1.6) or later, and can be
      built and deployed properly with Sun's 6.x, or later.</li>

      <li>All RMI client/server communications are now SSL encrypted,
      and any RMI calls that were previously made from the server to
      the client have been reversed so that clients will work properly
      on systems with local firewalls.  In addition, Ganymede no
      longer requires an external RMI registry process.</li>

      <li>Ganymede 2.0 supports a new <a
      href="synchronization/index.html">incremental XML build
      system</a> that can enqueue directory changes for transmission
      to external directory services that support discrete change
      commands.</li>

      <li>Ganymede 2.0 has an <a
      href="querylanguage/index.html">SQL-like textual query
      language</a> which is available for programming in the Ganymede
      framework, as well as for doing direct queries with the <a
      href="xml/xmlclient.html">xmlclient</a>.</li>

      <li>The Ganymede client, server, and admin console are
      internationalized, and all user-facing message strings have been
      pulled into language-specific resource files to support easy
      translation.  A German language translation is included.</li>
      
      <li>Scalability and performance is now very significantly
      improved, particularly in XML processing.  Overall memory usage
      of the server has been reduced by at least 15%.</li>

      <li>A number of changes have been made to the Ganymede data
      model and APIs to ensure correct and predictable behavior,
      including a new requirement that all objects have guaranteed
      unique labels.  There were some minor changes to the XML schema
      used for data dumping and loading.  It is now possible to group
      object fields in custom tabs to reduce clutter in the
      client.</li>

      <li>A significant number of fit, polish, and reliability
      improvements have been made to every part of the Ganymede
      product.  The client and admin console now use the Java 1.4
      Preferences API to remember window position and other
      miscellaneous details.  The Ganymede client can now receive and
      transmit Ganymede XML data.</li>

      <li>The Ganymede server will now generate an 'externalerror'
      system event if an external build returns a non-zero result
      code.  You can take advantage of this feature to properly
      monitor your builds.</li>

      <li>Ganymede now knows how to generate hash text for passwords
      in OpenLDAP/Netscape's Salted SHA password hash format, as well
      as Ulrich Drepper's <a
      href="http://people.redhat.com/drepper/sha-crypt.html">Unix
      Crypt with Sha</a> algorithm.</li>

      <li>Ganymede is now a U.S. registered trademark of The
      University of Texas at Austin.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For a comprehensive list of changes in the 2.0 release, please
    see the <a href="../CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file.  You should be
    especially sure to consult this file if you have any previous
    programming experience with the Ganymede framework, as a good
    number of minor changes have accumulated over the last few
    years.</p>

    <h2>Schema Changes</h2>

    <ul>
    <li><p>A number of fields have been renamed since Ganymede 1.0.  These
    renames should be handled automatically for you if you try to load
    a Ganymede 1.0 series database file with a Ganymede 2.0 server,
    but if you are doing XML loading, you may need to be aware of the
    following name changes:</p>

    <table border="1">
    <tr><th>Object</th><th>Field Number</th><th>Field Type</th><th>Old Field Name</th><th>New Field Name</th></tr>
    <tr><td>System Event</td><td>103</td><td>boolean</td><td>Event Mail</td><td>Send Mail</td></tr>
    <tr><td>System Event</td><td>106</td><td>boolean</td><td>Cc Owner Groups</td><td>Cc Owners</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Owner Group</td><td>105</td><td>string</td><td>Mail List</td><td>External Mail List</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Role</td><td>101</td><td>permission matrix</td><td>Owned Object Bits</td><td>Objects Owned Access Bits</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Role</td><td>103</td><td>permission matrix</td><td>Default Bits</td><td>Default Access Bits</td></tr>
    </table></li>

    <li><p>If you have a Ganymede 1.x schema that does not force unique
    labels on all object types, Ganymede 2.0 will give you a warning
    when you go to load your old ganymede.db file.  If you bring up
    the Ganymede schema editor or use the xmlclient to tweak the
    schema, no changes will accepted to your schema until you resolve
    the unique label issue.</p></li>

    <li><p>The <b>Objects Owned</b> Invid field in the <b>Owner Group</b>
    object has been removed.  This change makes it possible for
    multiple administrators to create objects in a common <b>Owner
    Group</b> without experiencing lock-out.  This will again be
    handled for you automatically if you load a Ganymede 1.0 db file,
    but if you are working with XML, you may need be aware of this,
    particularly when loading Permission Matrix dumps.</p></li>

    <li><p>If you have custom plugin classes written against Ganymede
    1.0, you will absolutely need to make some changes in order to get
    your classes working properly in Ganymede 2.0.</p>

    <p>The most elementary change is that classes in the Ganymede
    server have been shuffled around to different packages for clarity
    in the source tree and build process.  You will need to make sure
    you use <b>arlut.csd.ganymede.common</b> for classes that are used
    on the server and on the client, <b>arlut.csd.ganymede.rmi</b> for
    RMI interfaces, and <b>arlut.csd.ganymede.server</b> for the
    classes that uniquely comprise the Ganymede server.</p>

    <p>A wide variety of methods in several classes in the Ganymede
    server now throw an
    <b>arlut.csd.ganymede.common.GanyPermissionException</b> when permission
    problems are encountered.  This is a checked exception, so you may
    need to modify your code to handle this exception
    intelligently.</p>

    <p>The DBEditObject 'deleting' boolean has been made private.
    You'll need to use the <b>DBEditObject.isDeleting()</b> method to test
    the deleting status of an editable object.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, I believe the classes you'll use in writing your own
    plugin subclasses for DBEditObject and GanymedeBuilder shouldn't
    need a great deal of changes.  Most of the other method changes
    have been done in a backwards compatible fashion.</p>

    <p>If you're writing a new set of plugin classes, you may find
    that there are some more convenient methods to use when writing
    your custom logic than were available in the 1.x time frame.  For
    instance, many methods that deal with fields allow you to look up
    or address fields by their display name, rather than having to use
    numeric codes.  Be aware that if you use the name-based methods,
    you will make it difficult for yourself if you want to produce a
    version of your schema kit in other languages, however.</li>

    <li><p>Vector fields can no longer hold duplicates.  This was
    implicit in some of the code before, it is now explicit.  If you
    attempt to load an old ganymede.db file that includes duplicate
    values in a Vector field, the system will allow the duplication,
    and this can surprise some code.</p>

    <p>So, beware.  When in doubt, use xmlclient in your Ganymede 1.x
    installation to dump your data to disk, examine for duplicates,
    and reload into your 2.x installation using the
    xmlclient.</p></li>

    </ul>
