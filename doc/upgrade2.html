         you'll need to think about if you are upgrading from an installation

    <h2>Welcome to Ganymede 2.0</h2>

    <p>While Ganymede 2.0 is more similar to Ganymede 1.0 than it is
    different, the 2.0 series is the product of nearly ten years of
    development and refinement, and essentially every facet of the
    product has been polished to a high shine, relative to the
    Ganymede 1.0 releases.</p>

    <p>The major functional differences between the Ganymede 1.0
    series and Ganymede 2.0 are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All RMI client/server communications are now SSL encrypted.</li>

      <li>Ganymede 2.0 supports a new <a
      href="synchronization/index.html">incremental XML build
      system</a> that can enqueue directory changes for transmission
      to external directory services that support discrete change
      commands.</li>

      <li>Ganymede 2.0 has an <a
      href="querylanguage/index.html">SQL-like textual query
      language</a> which is available for programming in the Ganymede
      framework, as well as for doing direct queries with the <a
      href="xml/xmlclient.html">xmlclient</a>.</li>
      
      <li>Scalability and performance is now very significantly
      improved, particularly in XML processing.  Memory usage of the
      server has been reduced by at least 15%.</li>

      <li>A number of changes have been made to the Ganymede data
      model and APIs to ensure correct and predictable behavior,
      including a new requirement that all objects have guaranteed
      unique labels.  There were some minor changes to the XML schema
      used for data dumping and loading as well.</li>

      <li>A significant number of fit, polish, and reliability
      improvements have been made to every part of the Ganymede
      product.</li>

      <li>The entire source code tree has been refactored for clarity,
      and the build system is now based on Ant.</li>

      <li>The Ganymede client, server, and admin console are
      internationalized, and all user-facing message strings have been
      pulled into language-specific resource files to support easy
      translation.</li>

      <li>Ganymede now requires Java 1.4 or later, and can be built
      and deployed properly with Sun's Java 1.4, 5.x, or 6.x.</li>

      <li>Ganymede is now a U.S. registered trademark of The
      University of Texas at Austin.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For a comprehensive list of changes in the 2.0 release, please
    see the <a href="../CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file.  You should be
    especially sure to consult this file if you have any previous
    programming experience with the Ganymede framework, as a good
    number of minor changes have accumulated over the last few
    years.</p>

    <h2>Schema Changes</h2>

    <p>A number of fields have been renamed since Ganymede 1.0.  These
    renames will be handled automatically for you if you try to load a
    Ganymede 1.0 series database file with a Ganymede 2.0 server, but
    if you are doing XML loading, you'll need to be aware of the
    following name changes:</p>

    <table border="1">
    <tr><th>Object</th><th>Field Number</th><th>Field Type</th><th>Old Field Name</th><th>New Field Name</th></tr>
    <tr><td>System Event</td><td>103</td><td>boolean</td><td>Event Mail</td><td>Send Mail</td></tr>
    <tr><td>System Event</td><td>106</td><td>boolean</td><td>Cc Owner Groups</td><td>Cc Owners</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Owner Group</td><td>105</td><td>string</td><td>Mail List</td><td>External Mail List</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Role</td><td>101</td><td>permission matrix</td><td>Owned Object Bits</td><td>Objects Owned Access Bits</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Role</td><td>103</td><td>permission matrix</td><td>Default Bits</td><td>Default Access Bits</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>In addition, the <b>Objects Owned</b> Invid field in the
    <b>Owner Group</b> object has been removed.  (It has been made
    redundant.  It is now enough for the Ganymede server to know what
    each object thinks are its owners.. the Owner Groups themselves
    don't need to know anymore.)  This will again be handled for you
    automatically if you load a Ganymede 1.0 db file, but if you are
    working with XML, you may need be aware of this, particularly when
    loading Permission Matrix dumps.</p>
