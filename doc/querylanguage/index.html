        <p>A description of the simple SQL-like Ganymede Query
        Language (GanyQL) supported by Ganymede 2.0.</p>

        <p>Starting with version 2.0, Ganymede supports a simple
        textual query language to represent queries against the
        Ganymede data store.  The Ganymede server incorporates a
        translator to turn queries specified in the new Ganymede Query
        Language (GanyQL) into the old-school linked tree
        representation that Ganymede has always supported behind the scenes.</p>

        <p> Programmers writing code directly to the internal Ganymede
        API can make use of GanyQL to simplify their coding on plugins
        and the like and, best of all, end users can make use of
        GanyQL directly from the command line using the Ganymede 2.0

    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In Ganymede 1.0, the only way to query the Ganymede data store
    was to manually create a Ganymede <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/Query.html">arlut.csd.ganymede.common.Query</a>
    object with a linked tree of <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/QueryNode.html">arlut.csd.ganymede.common.QueryNode</a>
    objects representing the query's exploded parse tree.  Programming
    queries into the Ganymede server was difficult, and creating shell
    scripts to pull arbitrary data from the Ganymede server was simply
    impossible.  Any queries, no matter how simple, required the
    creation of custom Java code to assemble the appropriate
    structured query trees.</p>

    <p>To bring light into this darkness, Ganymede 2.0 introduces a
    simple new Ganymede Query Language called <span
    class="definition">GanyQL</span>.  GanyQL is very loosely
    patterned after SQL syntax, and is designed to make it possible to
    express queries on the Ganymede data store in a human-readable and
    direct fashion.  All you need to do is write a bit of GanyQL and
    parsing code on the Ganymede server will take care of translating
    your request into the Ganymede query engine's internal
    structure.</p>

    <p>GanyQL was designed and implemented by Deepak Giridharagopal
    using Terrance Parr's excellent <a
    href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> parser generation system.
    If you ever find yourself needing to incorporate language parsing
    into your development project, we recommend ANTLR to you without
    reservation.  It is a superb tool.</p>

    <h2>What it looks like</h2>

    <p>Here are some examples of what GanyQL queries look like:</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p><code><span class="keyword">select object from editable</span> "User" <span class="keyword">where</span> "UID" <span class="keyword">&gt;=</span> 2000</code></p>
      <p><code><span class="keyword">select</span> "Username","UID" <span class="keyword">from editable</span> "User"</code></p>
      <p><code><span class="keyword">select</span> "Username" <span class="keyword">from</span> "User" <span class="keyword">where</span> "Expiration Date" <span class="keyword">defined</span></code></p>

      <p><code><span class="keyword">select</span> "GroupName","GID" <span class="keyword">from</span> "Group" <span class="keyword">where</span> "Notes" <span class="keyword">=~_ci</span> "(atl|isl) group"</code></p>

      <p><code><span class="keyword">select</span> "Username","UID","Home Group" <span class="keyword">from editable</span> "User"
      <span class="keyword">where</span> "Home Group"<span class="keyword">-&gt;(</span>"GID" <span class="keyword">>=</span> 2000 <span class="keyword">and</span> "GID" <span class="keyword">&lt;=</span> 8000<span class="keyword">)</span></code></p>

      <p><code><span class="keyword">select</span> "Name" <span class="keyword">from</span> "Owner Group" <span class="keyword">where</span> "Admin
       Persona"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"User"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"Home Group"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"Users" <span class="keyword">len&lt;=</span> 5</code></p>
    </div>

    <p>In English, these queries are as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Return all user objects in the Ganymede server that I have
      permission to edit whose UID field contains a value greater than
      or equal to 2000.</li>

      <li>Return a list of user names and uids for all users in the
      Ganymede server that I have permission to edit.</li>

      <li>Return a list of user names for all users in the Ganymede
      server that I have permission to read and which have a non-empty
      Expiration Date field.</li>

      <li>Return a list of GroupName and GIDs for all groups in the
      Ganymede server that I have permission to read and whose Notes
      field contains any text that matches '(atl|isl) group' using a
      case-insensitive Perl 5-style regular expression match.</li>

      <li>Return a list of Usernames, UIDs and Home Groups for users
      in the Ganymede server that I have permission to edit and whose
      Home Group field points to a Group object whose GID field is
      between 2000 and 8000, inclusive.</li>

      <li>Return a list of Names for Owner Group objects in the
      Ganymede server that I have permission to read and whose Admin
      Persona field points to an admin persona whose User field points
      to a user whose Home Group field points to a group whose Users
      field has five or fewer users in it.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>As you can see from these examples, you can express some quite
    involved queries with a very little bit of GanyQL.</p>

    <p>As powerful as it is, and as much as the syntax is designed to
    look like SQL, GanyQL is really very different.  Queries are made
    on objects, not tables, and you can't get back data from multiple
    kinds of objects with a single query.  You can express queries and
    subqueries that traverse Ganymede's object pointer (invid) fields,
    though, which makes up somewhat for the lack of table joins and
    the like.</p>

    <p>Perhaps most significant is the fact that, unlike SQL, GanyQL
    is <b>just</b> a query language.  To actually submit data changes
    to the Ganymede server, you need to use the <a
    href="../xml/xmlclient.html">xmlclient</a> in conjunction with the
    <a href="../xml.html">Ganymede XML data format</a>.</p>

    <h2>The syntax</h2>

    <p class="note">To fully express the syntax of GanyQL would
    require an exposition as long and precise as the actual <a
    href="query.g">GanyQL grammar</a>.  If you've had any experience
    with abstract syntax definitions, you may find reading the grammar
    both interesting and informative.</p>

    <h3>Gross Structure</h3>

    <p>The GanyQL syntax is reasonably simple.  All queries in GanyQL
    have this general structure:</p>

    <div class="example"><span class="keyword">select</span> <i>return values</i> <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="optkeyword">editable</span> "<i>Object Type</i>" <span class="optkeyword">where</span> <i>test expression</i></div>

    <p>The words in <span class="keyword">boldface</span> are
    mandatory keywords.  Words in <span class="optkeyword">italic
    boldface</span> are optional, and text in <i>plain italics</i> are
    where you will have to provide input.</p>

    <p>The "<i>Object Type</i>" string is the name of the type of
    object in the Ganymede data store that you want to query.  As with
    all strings you use in GanyQL, you'll need to surround the name of
    the object type in either single or double quotation characters,
    and you'll need to be sure you've got the capitalization
    right.</p>

    <p>The <i>return values</i> can either be the <span
    class="keyword">object</span> keyword, if you want to get back all
    fields from the object, or a comma-separated list of field name
    strings to be retrieved from "<i>Object Type</i>".</p>

    <p>The <span class="keyword">editable</span> keyword is optional.
    If it is present, the query will only examine and return objects
    that you have permission to check out for editing.  If <span
    class="keyword">editable</span> is not present, the query will
    match against all objects of the appropriate type that you have
    permission to view.</p>

    <p>Finally, there's the optional where clause and test expression.
    If you do not provide a where clause, all objects of the
    appropriate Object Type that you have permission to see and/or
    edit will be returned.</p>

    <h3>The Where Clause</h3>

    <p>If you do provide a where clause, you can place specific
    restrictions on the objects you are interested in querying.</p>

    <p>The where clause consists of the <span
    class="keyword">where</span> keyword followed by a logical
    combination of field tests.  These tests are specified using
    simple operators, and can be combined using the logical operators
    <span class="keyword">and</span>, <span class="keyword">or</span>,
    and <span class="keyword">not</span>.  You can also use
    parentheses to control the grouping of expressions.</p>

    <p>The field tests supported by GanyQL are listed in the following table:</p>

    <table><caption>Field Test Operators</caption>
      <tr><th>Operator</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Field Types</th><th>Argument Types</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">=~</span></td>
        <td>Regular Expression Match</td>
        <td>Invid, I.P. Address, String</td>
        <td>Regular Expression</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">=~_ci</span></td>
        <td>Regular Expression Match (case insensitive)</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>Less Than or Equal</td>
        <td>Date, Float, Invid, Number, String</td>
        <td>String, Date, Numeric</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>Greater Than</td>
        <td>Date, Float, Invid, Number, String</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>Begins With</td>
        <td>Invid, I.P. Address, String</td>
        <td>String</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">ends</span></td>
        <td>Ends With</td>
        <td>Invid, I.P. Address, String</td>
        <td>String</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">len&lt;</span></td>
        <td>Array Length Less Than</td>
        <td>Any array field</td>
        <td>Numeric</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">len&lt;=</span></td>
        <td>Array Length Less Than or Equal</td>
        <td>Any array field</td>
        <td>Numeric</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">len&gt;</span></td>
        <td>Array Length Greater Than</td>
        <td>Any array field</td>
        <td>Numeric</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">len&gt;=</span></td>
        <td>Array Length Greater Than or Equal</td>
        <td>Any array field</td>
        <td>Numeric</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">len==</span></td>
        <td>Array Length Equality</td>
        <td>Any array field</td>
        <td>Numeric</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">defined</span></td>
        <td>Field is defined (not empty)</td>
        <td>All</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Most of these field test operators take a pair of arguments,
    with the name of the field to look at before the operator and a
    value to compare the field to after the operator.</p>

    <p>The sole exceptions to this pattern is the <span
    class="keyword">defined</span> operator, which does not take a
    comparison value.</p>

    <p>The field tests can be combined with the following
    operators:</p>

    <table><caption>Logical Operators</caption>
      <tr><th>Operator</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">and</span></td>
        <td>Logical AND</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">or</span></td>
        <td>Logical OR</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">not</span></td>
        <td>Logical Negation</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">(&nbsp;)</span></td>
        <td>Grouping</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Finally, GanyQL features a special pointer field dereference
    operator, which can be used to extend queries to objects linked
    from the primary object type being queried.</p>

    <table><caption>Pointer Dereference</caption>
      <tr><th>Operator</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="keyword">-&gt;</span></td>
        <td>Test Linked Object</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>There are two ways to use the <span
    class="keyword">-&gt;</span> operator.  You can use the pointer
    dereference operator to execute a specific test against a field in
    the object pointed to by the invid field being dereferenced, or
    you can use the parentheses to execute a logical combination of
    tests on multiple fields in the object pointed to.</p>

    <p>For example, both of these examples work just fine:</p>

    <div class="example">
       <p><code>"<i>invid field</i>"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"<i>field</i>" <span class="keyword">==</span> "<i>value</i>"</code></p>
       <p><code>"<i>invid field</i>"<span class="keyword">-&gt;(</span>"<i>field 1</i>" <span class="keyword">==</span> "<i>value1</i>" <span class="keyword">and</span> "<i>field2</i>" <span class="keyword"><</span> 200<span class="keyword">)</span></code></p>
    </div>

    <p>In the latter case, the tests against "field1" and "field2" are
    evaluated for each object that is pointed to by "invid field" in
    the primary query.  If "invid field" is a multivalued invid array
    field, the test will be applied against each object pointed to by
    "invid field" until the test is passed or all invids in the array
    have been examined, whichever comes first.</p>

    <p>Through the use of the pointer dereference operator, it is
    possible to create queries that can examine quite a lot of objects
    in an attempt to determine matches against the query expression.</p>

    <p>Here's another example:</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p><code>"<i>invid field</i>"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"<i>invid field2</i>"<span class="keyword">-&gt;(</span>"<i>GID</i>" <span class="keyword">&lt;=</span> 3000 <span class="keyword">or</span> "<i>Users</i>"<span class="keyword">-&gt;(</span>"UID" <span class="keyword">&lt;</span> 4000 <span class="keyword">or</span> "<i>User Netgroup</i>"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"<i>Members</i>"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"<i>UID</i>" <span class="keyword">&gt;</span> 8192<span class="keyword">))</span></code></p>
    </div>

    <p>This query expression returns true for all objects which have
    an "invid field" which points to an object which has an "invid
    field2" that points to an object that has either a "GID" field
    that is less than or equal to 3000, or that has either a "Users"
    field which points to an object that has either a "UID" field
    which is less than 4000 or a "User Netgroup" field which points to
    an object that has a "Members" field which points to an object
    that has a "UID" field which holds a value greater than 8192.</p>

    <p>If we assume that all invid fields involved in pointer
    dereferencing in this query are single-valued (not array) fields,
    to evaluate this query could require the Ganymede server to
    examine fully six objects:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The object that contains the "invid field"</li>
      <li>The object pointed to by "invid field"</li>
      <li>The object pointed to by "invid field"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"invid field2"</li>
      <li>The object pointed to by "invid field"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"invid field2"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"Users"</li>
      <li>The object pointed to by "invid field"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"invid field2"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"Users"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"User Netgroup"</li>
      <li>The object pointed to by "invid field"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"invid field2"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"Users"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"User Netgroup"<span class="keyword">-&gt;</span>"Members"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If any of those invid (object pointer) fields are actually
    multivalued array fields, the number of objects that may need to
    be examined to determine the truth of this expression for a single
    object may increase by the product of the number of values in each
    of these invid fields.  If, say, the "Users", "User Negroup", and
    "Members" fields were each array invid fields, with four values in
    each of the fields we examine to test this query expression, that
    would add up to an additional 64 objects that might need to be
    examined in order to determine the truth of this expression for a
    single "invid field".</p>

    <p>In general, you probably won't need to get this crazy with
    subqueries, but it's nice to know that the system is willing to do
    so much work for you if necessary.</p>
