    <p><blockquote>Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle,
      and quick to anger. -- J.R.R. Tolkein</blockquote></p>

    <p>Ganymede is all about storing and manipulating data objects.
    When a user sits down to work with Ganymede, he issues commands to
    create, delete, and edit objects.  These commands are given to the
    Ganymede client, which in turn uses RMI to call methods on objects
    held on the server, using the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Session.html">Session</a>, <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/db_object.html">db_object</a>,
    and <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/db_field.html">db_field</a>
    RMI remote interfaces.  In response to these method calls, the
    server attempts to make changes to fields and objects in its
    database.  Not all such method calls can succeed, however.  The
    user may not have appropriate permissions for the attempted
    operation, or the operation may not make sense in the context of
    other objects in the database.  In such cases, those method calls
    have to be able to return a failure report to the client.</p>

    <p>This is achieved in the Ganymede server by the use of <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    objects.  All database-changing method calls on <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Session.html">Session</a>, <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/db_object.html">db_object</a>,
    and <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/db_field.html">db_field</a>
    references return <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    objects to provide detailed results to the client.</p>

    <p>All methods that return <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    objects work in the same general way.  Most methods will return
    <code>null</code> if the operation succeeded and no special value
    needed to be returned to the client.  Some methods (such as <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Session.html#edit_db_object(arlut.csd.ganymede.Invid)">Session.edit_db_object()</a>)
    will have to return a <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    on success so that the client can extract the remote <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/db_object.html">db_object</a>
    reference from the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    object's <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html#getObject()">getObject()</a>
    method.  At other times, an operation may succeed but require that
    the client be given a list of objects and fields to update so that
    the user will see changes made across objects in all objects that
    are affected.  More on this later.</p>

    <p>If a <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    object is returned from the server, the client will call its <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html#didSucceed()">didSucceed()</a>
    method to learn whether the operation succeeded or failed.</p>

    <p>Success or failure is the most basic information that can be
    carried by a <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    object.  If an attempted operation could not be performed, the
    user will be wondering why.  We can't leave the user wondering, so
    <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    objects can pass a dialog definition to the client for
    display.</p>

    <p>And therein lies a tale.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tr BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC">
	<td colspan="1"><h2><b>Dialogs and ReturnVal Objects</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The Ganymede client contains a piece of code called a <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/StringDialog.html">StringDialog</a>.  The
    <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/StringDialog.html">StringDialog</a>
    class is a generic dialog class that can display a variety of
    information as specified by a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/DialogRsrc.html">DialogRsrc</a>
    object.  The <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/DialogRsrc.html">DialogRsrc</a>
    object, in turn, can be constructed from a <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    object.</p>

    <p>The <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    object is designed so that it can be passed over the RMI link
    between the server and the client.  In this way, the server can
    provide a dialog specification for the client to display.</p>

    <p>As you have guessed by now, the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    objects passed from the server to the client can include a <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    dialog description.  The client can access this dialog by calling
    the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    object's <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html#getDialog()">getDialog()</a>
    method.</p>

    <p><a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>'s
    are general-purpose dialog definition structures.  The <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    constructors can take a string for the dialog's title, another
    string for the main body, strings for the ok and optional cancel
    buttons, and a filename for an image to be displayed on the left
    side of the dialog, as shown below:</p>

    <p><img src="dialog1.jpg"></p>

    <p>In order to return the above dialog to the user, the server
    might contain the following code:</p>

    <pre>
       <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a> retVal = new <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html#constructor_summary">ReturnVal</a>(false);  // failure
       <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a> dialogDef = new <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html#constructor_summary">JDialogBuff</a>("Error",
	                                       "Couldn't log in to server.. bad username/password?",
	                                       "Ok",
	                                       null,          // no cancel button
	                                       "error.gif");
       retVal.<a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html#setDialog(arlut.csd.JDialog.JDialogBuff)">setDialog</a>(dialogDef);
       return retVal;
    </pre>

    <p>Note that the string used for the title will appear in the
    dialog itself, as well as in the dialog's title bar.  The string
    provided for the body will be word-wrapped to fit in the displayed
    dialog, and can include explicit newline characters to break the
    text into paragraphs.  The image shown in the dialog is called
    <code>error.gif</code>, and refers to an image resource available
    to the client.  The following images are guaranteed to be
    available to the client through its jar file:</p>

    <p>
      <table border="1" cellpadding="3">
	<tr>
	  <td align="center"><img src="error.gif"></td>
	  <td align="center"><img src="ok.gif"></td>
	  <td align="center"><img src="question.gif"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td><code>error.gif</code></td>
	  <td><code>ok.gif</code></td>
	  <td><code>question.gif</code></td>
	</tr>
      <caption valign="bottom">Standard Dialog Images</caption>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>Error dialogs of the kind shown above are created often enough in the Ganymede server
    that there is a special method provided to simplify this process.  The following
    code does exactly the same as the code above:</p>

    <pre>
       return <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymede.html#createErrorDialog(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)">Ganymede.createErrorDialog</a>("Error", "Couldn't log in to server.. bad username/password?");
    </pre>

    <p><a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    has more tricks.  In addition to a title, icon and
    body of text, the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/StringDialog.html">StringDialog</a>
    created on the client from the <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    can display one or more GUI widgets that the user can fill in, as
    in the following:</p>
    
    <p><img src="dialog2.jpg"></p>

    <p>In order to return the above dialog to the user, the server
    might contain the following code:</p>

    <pre>
       <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a> retVal = new <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html#constructor_summary">ReturnVal</a>(false);  // failure
       <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a> dialogDef = new <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html#constructor_summary">JDialogBuff</a>("Reactivate User",
	                                       null,
	                                       "Ok",
	                                       "Cancel",
	                                       "question.gif");

       dialogDef.<a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html#addPassword(java.lang.String, boolean)">addPassword</a>("New Password", true);

       Vector choices = new Vector();

       choices.addElement("/bin/bash");  // in real life, these are extracted from the database
       choices.addElement("/bin/tcsh");
       choices.addElement("/bin/ksh");

       dialogDef.<a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html#addChoice(java.lang.String, java.util.Vector, java.lang.String)">addChoice</a>("Shell", choices, "/bin/bash");

       dialogDef.<a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html#addString(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)">addString</a>("Forwarding Address", null);

       retVal.<a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html#setDialog(arlut.csd.JDialog.JDialogBuff)">setDialog</a>(dialogDef);
       return retVal;
    </pre>

    <p>There is one problem with the example above, though.  What is the client supposed
    to do with the GUI fields that have been added?  They are obviously there so that
    the user can answer some questions, but then what?</p>

    <p>Ah.  Now we're getting into the land where wizards get involved.</p>

    <p>In addition to the success/failure code and <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    dialog definition, the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    object can also carry a <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html">Ganymediator</a>
    RMI remote reference.  Just as the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html#setDialog(arlut.csd.JDialog.JDialogBuff)">setDialog</a>
    method is used to register a <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    to be returned to the client, so is the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html#setCallback(arlut.csd.ganymede.Ganymediator)">setCallback</a>
    used to register a remote <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html">Ganymediator</a>
    reference to be passed back to the client.</p>

    <p>The <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html">Ganymediator</a>
    reference is a different sort of thing from the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    object, however.  The <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html">Ganymediator</a>
    reference is an RMI remote reference to an object on the server,
    while the value of the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    object is actually passed to the client.</p>

    <p>If the client gets a <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    back from the server that contains both a <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>u
    object and a <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html">Ganymediator</a>
    reference, the client will engage in a <b>wizard interaction
    sequence</b>.</p>

    <p>How this works is simple.  The client takes the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    from the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    object, and displays the dialog to the user.  When the user is
    finished interacting with the dialog, the client packages up the
    values from the dialog and does an RMI call to the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html">Ganymediator</a>
    object on the server, using the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html#respond(java.util.Hashtable)">respond()</a>
    method defined in the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html">Ganymediator</a>
    interface.  That <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html#respond(java.util.Hashtable)">respond()</a>
    method will in response return another <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    object, or <code>null</code> if the interaction sequence has
    completed successfully.  Any of the subsequently returned <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    objects may themselves carry additional <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    objects and <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html">Ganymediator</a>
    references, in which case the interaction continues.</p>

    <p>In this way, the client, and the server do a little dance to
    walk the user through a series of dialogs.  The final <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    returned by the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html">Ganymediator</a>
    will have the final results of whatever operation initiated the
    wizard sequence.  Any method call in <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Session.html">Session</a>, <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/db_object.html">db_object</a>,
    and <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/db_field.html">db_field</a>
    that return <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
    objects can interpose a wizard by simply encoding a
    <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/JDialog/JDialogBuff.html">JDialogBuff</a>
    object and a <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html">Ganymediator</a>
    remote reference.</p>

    <p>But where does the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html">Ganymediator</a>
    reference come from?  And how does the server keep track of the status
    of a wizard?</p>

    <p>Again, the answer is simple.  All of the wizard bookkeeping is done
    by a clever little class called <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html">GanymediatorWizard</a></p>

    <p>In order to talk about the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html">GanymediatorWizard</a>
    class, I'm going to present and walk through an actual (although
    somewhat simplified) Ganymede wizard from the gasharl schema kit.
    This wizard is presented to the user when he attempts to edit an
    existing user object's username field.  When such a change is
    attempted, the <code>userCustom</code> <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
    subclass which is bound to the user object in the Ganymede server
    (see the wonderful <a href="index.html">DBEditObject Subclassing
    Guide</a>)'s <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a> method
    detects the operation and, instead of returning null to give the
    operation the ok, creates the wizard and gets the whole process
    going, as follows:</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

  </pre>

  <p>In fact, in the real code we check some more things out, like whether the user is
  being newly created (in which case we don't want to complain about a rename), or whether
  the user is being deleted (in which case we don't mind them setting the name to <code>null</code>).</p>

  <pre>

  <p>We're being called by the system because the <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/DBField.html">DBField</a>

  <p>The above section is a bit confusing.  What's going on here is that if/when the wizard finally
  ok's the operation, it's going to try to rename the user itself.  The above code is here
  so that if the wizard does try to rename the user, we won't force <b>IT</b> to have to deal
  with another copy of itself to get the operation approved.</p>

  <p>The <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymedeSession.html">GanymedeSession</a> object
  that tracks permissions and the user's activities in the Ganymede server also tracks whether
  a wizard is active.  Each client is only allowed one wizard at a time, until the wizard is
  unregistered() using the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html">GanymediatorWizard</a>
  <a

	// and set up the wizard and let the client play with it.

	    renameWizard = new userRenameWizard(this.gSession,

	// and return the initial dialog for the wizard.  The ReturnVal code
	// that wizard.respond() returns will have the success code
	// set to false, so whatever triggered us will prematurely exit,
	// returning the wizard's dialog.

	return renameWizard.respond(null);
  </pre>

  <p>We now have the wizard created, and we return the <a
  href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>
  object resulting from calling the renameWizard's <a

  <p>Remember that we got here by the client calling a method on a <a

  That <a

    return retVal;
  }
  </pre>

  <p>processDialog0 is called automatically by the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html">GanymediatorWizard</a>
  class the first time its <a
  href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/Ganymediator.html#respond(java.util.Hashtable)">respond()</a>
  method is called.  By returning the results of a <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html#fail(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String)">continueOn()</a>
  call, we are telling the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html">GanymediatorWizard</a> code that
  we want to continue with the dialog sequence, and we provide a dialog to the user, as follows:</p>

  <p><img src="renameDialog0.jpg"></p>

  <pre>

  /**
   *
   * The client will call us in this state with a Boolean
   * param for key "Keep old name as an email alias?"

   */

  public ReturnVal processDialog1()
  {
    ReturnVal retVal = null;

    /* -- */

    System.err.println("userRenameWizard: USER_RENAME state 1 processing return vals from dialog");

    Boolean answer = (Boolean) <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html#getParam(java.lang.String)">getParam</a>("Keep old name as an email alias?");
  </pre>

  <p>When the client responded to our first dialog, they had the option of clicking on
  a checkbox to choose to keep the user's old name as an email alias for the new.  When
  the user hit the Ok button, the client packaged up all of the values associated
  with the GUI widgets and returned them in a serialized Hashtable to the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html#respond(java.util.Hashtable)">respond()</a>
  method, which unpacked the results for us.  We use the
  <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html#getParam(java.lang.String)">getParam()</a>
  method to get the value for that checkbox, using the name we gave it as the key.<?p>

  <pre>

    // One thing we need to check is whether the new name that they
    // are wanting is already an alias for them..

    StringDBField aliases = (StringDBField) userObject.getField(userSchema.ALIASES);

    if (aliases != null)
      {
	if (aliases.containsElementLocal(newname))
	  {
	    aliases.deleteElementLocal(newname);
	  }
      }

    <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html#state">state</a> = DONE;		// let the userCustom wizardHook know to go 
				// ahead and pass this operation through now
  </pre>

  <p>Again, this is very important.  By setting
  <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html#state">state</a>
  to <code>DONE</code>, we are effectively telling the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a> method in the userCustom class that we have
  finished with this user and that it should go ahead and perform the operation
  when we ask it to, which we do right now..</p>

  <pre>

    // note that this setValue() operation will pass
    // through userObject.wizardHook().  wizardHook will see that we are
    // an active userRenameWizard, and are at state DONE, so it
    // will go ahead and unregister us and let the name change
    // go through to completion.

    retVal = field.<a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/DBField.html#setValue(java.lang.Object)">setValue</a>(newname);
    System.err.println("userRenameWizard: Returned from field.setValue()");

    // now we need to add the old name to the alias list, possibly.

    if (answer != null && answer.booleanValue())
      {
	aliases.addElementLocal(oldname);
      }
  </pre>

  <p>The <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/DBField.html#setValue(java.lang.Object)">setValue()</a>
  call calls the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a> method again, which in our case returns some field rescan information
  to tell the client to update other fields in the user object which are affected by a user rename.  We're
  going to just tack on our own dialog here.</p>

  <pre>
    if (retVal.didSucceed())
      {
	retVal.<a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html#setDialog(arlut.csd.JDialog.JDialogBuff)">setDialog</a>(new JDialogBuff("User Rename Performed",
					 "OK, User renamed.",
					 "Thanks",
					 null,
					 "ok.gif"));
      }
  </pre>

  <p>If we didn't know that setValue() was going to return a non-null <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>, we would use the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html">GanymediatorWizard</a> 
  <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html#success(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String)">success()</a> method to create
  and return an 'all systems go' <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/ReturnVal.html">ReturnVal</a>.</p>

  <pre>
    return retVal;
  }
}
    </pre>

  <p>And if the user got through all of that, they'll see the following dialog:</p>

  <p><img src="renameOk.jpg"></p>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
    <tr BGCOLOR="#CCFFCC">
      <td colspan="1"><h2><b>Summary</b></h2></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The Ganymede wizard system is an attempt to make a tricky problem as simple as possible.
  The <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html">GanymediatorWizard</a>
  base class does a lot to keep everything working smoothly, so that all you need to do in
  order to make your own wizards is to subclass
  <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html">GanymediatorWizard</a>,
  to override <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html#cancel()">cancel()</a>,
  and to define processDialog0, processDialog1, and so on, for as many steps as you need
  to have.</p>

  <p>Although not shown in the example above, you can skip around in your dialog sequence by
  using the <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html">GanymediatorWizard</a>
  <a href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/GanymediatorWizard.html#setNextState(int)">setNextState()</a>
  method to force the wizard to generate the specified dialog as the next step in the sequence.</p>

  <p>The trickiest thing about wizard authoring in Ganymede is managing the logic interactions
  between your wizard and the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/DBEditObject.html#wizardHook(arlut.csd.ganymede.DBField, int, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)">wizardHook()</a> method in your custom <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/DBEditObject.html">DBEditObject</a>
  subclass.  Mistakes here will result in exceptions being thrown in
  the server during normal operations, so it's important to test your
  work on a server that is not running live.  The <a
  href="index.html">DBEditObject subclassing guide</a> remains the primary
  reference for writing custom plug-ins on the server.  Reading the code in the sample
  schemas included with the Ganymede distribution will help lots as
  well.</p>
