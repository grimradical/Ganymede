        <h1>The GanymedeBuildTask Synchronization Guide</h1>
        <p>Release 2.0 dev - ? ? 2005<br/>$Rev: 6615 $</p>
      </div>

      <div id="abstract">
        <p>This document is a guide to the use of the original
        Ganymede 1.0 GanymedeBuilderTask-based synchronization
        system.</p>

        <p>Most users new to Ganymede will want to avoid this style of
        implementing synchronization in favor of the newer and more
        simple XML synchronization system implemented in Ganymede
        2.0.</p>

        <p>Some users may be running legacy synchronization code from
        a Ganymede 1.0 installation, however, and others may need the
        flexibility to run custom logic to assemble their
        synchronization data.</p>

        <p>This guide is for them.</p>

        <p class="note">This document should be read after reading the <a
        href="index.html">Sync Channel Synchronization Guide</a>
        which, in addition to describing the new XML sync system, also
        provides a good conceptual overview of the ways in which
        synchronization can be carried out.</p>
      </div>

      <p>By <a href="mailto:jonabbey@arlut.utexas.edu">Jonathan Abbey</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>The original Ganymede synchronization model is based around
    full state synchronization, and was designed in conjunction with
    the Ganymede transactional model to support NIS and DNS.  Both of
    those directory services require all related changes to be made
    all at once before rebuilding their state ("pushing the maps" in
    NIS terminology, "rebuilding the BIND zone files" in DNS terms).</p>

    <p>Ganymede's approach to supporting these services is to
    implement a two phase building approach, using custom-written
    subclasses of the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html">arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeBuilderTask</a>
    class.  When a transaction is committed in Ganymede, the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeScheduler.html">
    arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeScheduler</a> class schedules a
    set of builder tasks for execution as soon as possible.  When a
    builder task runs, it locks the Ganymede database to prevent any
    new transactions from committing and it executes <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#builderPhase1()">builderPhase1()</a>.
    The builderPhase1() method scans the Ganymede database for
    whatever objects are relevant to the builder task's
    synchronization duties and writes that data out to disk, using
    whatever data format is convenient for the purposes of that
    synchronization channel.  When the builder task has completed its
    scan of the Ganymede database and all of its data has been written
    out, the builderPhase1() method returns, and the Ganymede database
    is unlocked so that any pending transactions can proceed
    to commit.</p>

    <p>The builder tasks then runs <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#builderPhase2()">builderPhase2()</a>.
    builderPhase2() is designed to execute an external program or script
    which reads the data written out by builderPhase1() and does
    whatever is necessary to integrate that data into the target
    directory services.  During the time that builderPhase2() is
    running, users are free to commit changes into the Ganymede
    database, but the Ganymede Scheduler is blocked from re-running the
    same builder task again.  This prevents any possibility of the
    builder task synchronization overlapping itself and overwriting
    data that a previous external build process may still be working
    with.</p>

    <p>Because the Ganymede Scheduler waits until a builder task has
    completed running before it relaunches the task, transactions are
    effectively transmitted in bulk to the target service.  If it
    takes 5 minutes for the external script run by builderPhase2() to
    complete, potentially hundreds or thousands of changes can be
    'saved up' for the builder task to handle when it finishes with
    the first synchronization.  In this way, the Ganymede server can
    allow users to commit changes at the fastest rate possible, while
    simultaneously synchronizing data to the target services at the
    fastest rate the synchronization process will allow.</p>

    <p>There are two difficulties with this synchronization model.
    The first is that by the time a builder task is executed by the
    Ganymede Scheduler, several minutes might have passed, during
    which time the Ganymede server will have completely forgotten
    about what the Ganymede server's data looked like before the
    transactions were committed.  Because of this, the
    GanymedeBuilderTask model is completely incapable of doing
    delta-style builds.  The best that it can do is to write out
    everything it knows to be true at the time the builderPhase1()
    method is run, and to depend on the external build process run by
    builderPhase2() to do any necessary before-and-after comparisons
    between the synchronization and the previous target state.</p>

    <p>The second difficulty with the GanymedeBuilderTask model is
    that it depends on a lot of custom code being written in Java and
    compiled into the Ganymede server.  In order to create a custom
    GanymedeBuilderTask, the adopter must create his own subclass of
    GanymedeBuilderTask and write all the logic for builderPhase1()
    and builderPhase2().  Further, if the code in either of these
    methods needs to be changed, either to fix a bug or to respond to
    a change made in the Ganymede server's schema, the server would
    have to be stopped and restarted after compiling and loading the
    new version of the builder task's code.</p>

    <p>Right now, we need to discuss how to actually go about
    constructing a GanymedeBuilderTask subclass to handle a full state
    build.</p>

    <h4 id="buildertask_creation">How To Create A Custom GanymedeBuilderTask Subclass</h4>

    <p>The <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html">GanymedeBuilderTask</a>
    class is responsible for coordinating all of the activities
    involved in scheduling and executing full state builds.  As an
    adopter and customizer of Ganymede, all you are responsible for is
    creating a subclass of <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html">GanymedeBuilderTask</a>
    that defines the <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#builderPhase1()">builderPhase1()</a>
    and <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#builderPhase2()">builderPhase2()</a>
    methods.</p>

    <p>The steps involved in creating a <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html">GanymedeBuilderTask</a>
    subclass and linking it into the server are very similar to those
    involved in <a
    href="../customization/index.html#subclass_creation">creating a
    DBEditObject subclass</a>.  You have to create a <code
    class="filename">.java</code> file that contains your subclass and
    place it under the server's <code
    class="filename">schema/custom_src</code> directory.  You then
    compile your code with the <code class="filename">build</code>
    script.  After you are sure that your code compiles successfully,
    you must shut down the server, rebuild the <a
    href="../glossary.html#custom.jar">custom.jar</a> file with the
    <code class="filename">buildCustomJar</code> script, and install
    the rebuilt <a href="../glossary.html#custom.jar">custom.jar</a>
    into the appropriate location.  You can then start up your server
    and your new <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html">GanymedeBuilderTask</a>
    subclass should be available for use by the Ganymede server.
    Available, but not yet configured for actual use.</p>

    <h4 id="creating_buildertask">Registering Your Builder Task For Execution</h4>

    <p>Once you have updated your server's <a
    href="../glossary.html#custom.jar">custom.jar</a> file with your
    new builder task, you have to register your new builder task with
    the server.  You do this by creating a new <code
    class="type">Task</code> object in the Ganymede server.  The <code
    class="type">Task</code> Object type is fully described in the <a
    href="../server.html#servertasks">Ganymede Server
    Overview</a>.</p>

    <p>For a builder task, there are four fields you need to worry
    about:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code class="type">Task Name</code> -- The name of the Task
      as seen in the admin console, must be unique in the Ganymede
      server.</li>

      <li><code class="type">Task Class</code> -- The fully qualified
      class name for your custom <a
      href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html">GanymedeBuilderTask</a>
      subclass, as defined in your <a
      href="../glossary.html#custom.jar">custom.jar</a> file.</li>

      <li><code class="type">Run On Transaction Commit</code> -- A
      check-box, should be checked to indicate that this task is to be
      scheduled for automatic execution.</li>

      <li>
	<code class="type">Option Strings</code> -- A Vector String
	field, used to provide optional run-time configuration
	information to builder tasks that are programmed to look for
	it.
	<br/>
	The strings in the <code class="type">Option Strings</code>
	field should all be in the form: <code class="example">key =
	value</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Below is an example of a builder task that has been
    registered in the Ganymede server.  It is configured to be
    scheduled for execution after transactions are committed, and it
    has a name and a class.</p>

    <center><img src="screenshots/builder_task.png" class="screenshot"/></center>

    <p>As soon as the admin hits the <code type="button">Commit</code>
    button at the bottom right, the task will be registered in the
    server.  From this commit on, the task will be scheduled for
    execution whenever a transaction is committed.</p>

    <p>Now, not every transaction or sequence of transactions
    committed will necessarily be of interest to any given builder
    task.  To help you deal with this, <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html">GanymedeBuilderTask</a>
    provides a method called <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#baseChanged(short)">baseChanged()</a>,
    which allows you to test to see whether any changes have been made
    to a given object type since the last time your builder task was
    run.  You'll see how this works in our example builder task in the
    next section.</p>
    
    <h4 id="buildertask_whaaaa">What A Builder Task Looks Like</h4>

    <p>What follows is a slightly simplified version of the
    UNIXBuilderTask class from the Ganymede userKit.  It will
    illustrate a lot of the principles of writing a full-state builder
    task with the GanymedeBuilderTask class.</p>

    <pre class="listing">package arlut.csd.ganymede.userKit;

import arlut.csd.ganymede.server.*;
import arlut.csd.ganymede.common.*;
import arlut.csd.Util.FileOps;

import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.io.*; </pre>

    <p>First we have our beginning declarations.  Generally speaking,
    you'll create a separate package for your custom schema classes, and
    you'll need to import everything from the
    <code>arlut.csd.ganymede.server</code> and
    <code>arlut.csd.ganymede.common</code> packages.</p>

<pre class="listing">/**

  private boolean backedup = false;

  {
    // set the taskDefObjInvid in GanymedeBuilderTask so
    // we can look up option strings

    taskDefObjInvid = _taskObjInvid;
  } </pre>

    <p>And here we see the class declaration subclassing
    GanymedeBuilderTask, member variable declarations, and our
    constructor, which must take an <a
    href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/common/Invid.html">Invid</a>
    parameter, and set the <a

  return result;
}</pre>

<p>And here we have our <a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#builderPhase1()">builderPhase1()</a>
method.  The important things to note here are the use of the <a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#getOptionValue(java.lang.String)">getOptionValue()</a>
method to look for option strings from our Task object, the use of the
<a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#baseChanged(short)">baseChanged()</a>
method to determine whether any objects of a given type have changed
since this builder task was last run, the use of the <a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#openOutFile(java.lang.String,
java.lang.String)">openOutFile()</a> method for opening files for
writing, and the use of the <a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#enumerateObjects(short)">enumerateObjects()</a>
method for iterating over objects of a given type.  Each of these
methods take advantage of logic built in to the GanymedeBuilderTask
class, and will help your builder task behave properly in the Ganymede
environment.</p>

<p class="note">As you may notice above, baseChanged() and
enumerateObjects() both take a numeric parameter (a short) to describe
what object type the method is to operate on.  This is a common idiom
in the internal Ganymede <a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBStore.html">DBStore</a> API.</p>

<p>The overall effect of this implementation of builderPhase1() is to
look to see whether any users or groups, as defined in the userKit
schema, have changed since this builder task was last run, and if so,
to write out passwd and group files suitable for integration into a
simple NIS or <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>, <code
class="filename">/etc/group</code> type environment.</p>

<p>If no users or groups have changed, this builderPhase1() method
will return false, which will tell the GanymedeBuilderTask base class
not to bother running builderPhase2().</p>

<pre class="listing">/**

}</pre>

<p><a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#builderPhase2()">builderPhase2()</a>,
by contrast, is much simpler.  It uses the <a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/Util/FileOps.html#runProcess(java.lang.String)">runProcess()</a>
method to try to run a builder script that is designated in the Task
object's <code class="type">Option Strings</code> field.  Finding and
running the external script is all that builderPhase2() is responsible
for.  The external builder script is responsible for making sure that
everything is set up for it to run.  The Ganymede server makes no
guarantees as to the working directory the script will be run in, and
no guarantees about what any environment variables will be set to.  If
your external builder script needs to worry about things like that,
you should make sure that your external builder script sets all that
up for itself.</p>

<p>The other thing you need to know when writing your external builder
script is that it should block until it finishes with its build.  The
Ganymede Scheduler creates an independent thread for each builder task
that runs, and it is expected that that thread will block until your
external builder task has completely finished its work.  If your
external builder script were to put itself into the background and
return early, the Ganymede Scheduler would consider the builder task
completely finished, and it would feel free to run the task all over
again, which might cause your builderPhase1() method to overwrite
files that your external builder script is still working with.</p>

<p>All of the rest of the class is dedicated to utility helper methods
that are used to handle chores for the <a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#builderPhase1()">builderPhase1()</a>
method.  One of the things you will notice about these methods is
that they have been written to use the Ganymede <a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObject.html">DBObject</a>
class API to access data from objects in the Ganymede data store.  You
will also notice that the calls to <a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/DBObject.html#getFieldValueLocal(short)">getFieldValueLocal()</a>
are using numeric identifiers, in this case defined in the <code
class="type">userSchema</code> and <code
class="type">groupSchema</code> interfaces, to retrieve specific
fields.</p>

<p>In general, whenever you use the GanymedeBuilderTask model for
handling synchronization, you will have to write Java code that uses
low-level details of the internal Ganymede API and that is aware of
the specific structure and details of your schema.  You're quite
correct if you consider the necessity of coding at this level to be a
disadvantage of using the GanymedeBuilderTask approach.</p>

    <h4 id="external_builder">Creating An External Sync Script For Use With GanymedeBuilderTask</h4>

<p>The <a href="UNIXBuilderTask.java">UNIXBuilderTask class</a> is the
piece of the GanymedeBuilderTask sync puzzle that is operating inside
the Ganymede server.  As you can see above, all the <a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#builderPhase2()">builderPhase2()</a>
method does is call out to an external builder script, which must read
the files written by <a
href="../javadoc/arlut/csd/ganymede/server/GanymedeBuilderTask.html#builderPhase1()">builderPhase1()</a> and
do something productive with them.</p>

<p>What "something productive" means may vary considerably from
installation to installation, and that's up for you to determine.
Whatever builder script you create will need to keep the following
things in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Ganymede server will not write to your builder script's
standard input stream.</li>

<li>Anything your script writes to its standard output or error
streams will be completely ignored by Ganymede, and lost.  You are
responsible for making your builder script log any error conditions to
something other than standard error.</li>

<li>Your script should not expect any command line arguments from Ganymede.</li>

<li>Your script should not expect to have any useful environment
variables set by Ganymede.</li>

<li>Your script should not expect to have its current working
directory set to anything useful or meaningful by Ganymede.</li>

<li>Your script should not terminate until the synchronization process
is truly finished, and it is safe for the Ganymede server to begin a
new external synchronization.</li>
</ul>

<p>At ARL:UT, our Ganymede builder script is a simple Bourne shell
script that sets environment variables and working conditions before
running make on a makefile, redirecting make's output to log files for
later examination.  By creating appropriate makefile dependencies on
the various synchronization files written by Ganymede, the make
program can make decisions for us as to what pieces of the build need
to be redone.  If the Ganymede server didn't write a new group file,
we don't bother doing any group updates.  Building this sort of
intelligence into your external builder script may reduce the time it
takes to run the average build for your network.</p>

<p>If you want to reduce your average build time still further, you'll
need to move to an incremental model for synchronization.</p>
