    <h1>Ganymede Developer Release 4 - Customization 30 July 1998</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>The Ganymede server has many advantages over the GASH project, including a graphical
    user interface, support for automated clients, and support for concurrent users.  The
    biggest advantage, however, is that the Ganymede server is totally customizable through
    the authoring of custom classes and the visual editing of the Ganymede server's database
    schema.</p>

    <h2>Schema Editing</h2>

    <p>The Ganymede Admin console has as one of its primary functions the ability to edit
    the Ganymede Database Schema.  You can access the schema editor when running the admin
    console as supergash.  You will then see a window pop up that will look something like
    the following:</p>

    <p><img src="gifs/schema2.gif"></p>

    <p>By clicking the right mouse button in the tree on the left of the schema editor window,
    you can create new object types, add, change or remove field definitions, and specify
    general parameters for field definitions.  You can also associate custom code modules
    with particular object types in the database.</p>

    <h2>Custom plug-ins for object management</h2>

    <p>You can look at the schema source code included in developer release 3 to see examples
    of custom plug-in objects to manage objects in the server.</p>

    <p>In order to have the server recognize plug-ins, you need to:

    <ul>
     <li>Modify the schema for the object type you wish to manage, giving a fully qualified
	 class name for the class.  i.e., <b>arlut.csd.ganymede.custom.ldapEntryCustom</b></li>
     <li>Compile your custom class and bind it into a jar file for the server.  The build and
         buildCustomJar scripts in the schema directory will do this work for you.</li>
     <li>Shut down the server from the Admin console so that the server gets a chance to
         do a full dump of the database file.  The journal file does not maintain information
	 about schema changes.</li>
     <li>Restart the server with your updated custom.jar file in place</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may wish to consult the following javadoc's for details on the DBEditObject base
    class that is subclassed to provide object intelligence on the server.</p>

    <UL>
    <LI><A HREF="javadoc/arlut.csd.ganymede.DBEditObject.html">The DBEditObject base class</A></LI>
    <LI><A HREF="javadoc/arlut.csd.ganymede.GanymediatorWizard.html">The GanymediatorWizard class</A></LI>
    </UL>

    <p>We are also developing a guide to DBEditObject subclass construction <a href="customization/index.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Custom plug-ins for scheduled and on-demand tasks</h2>

    <p>Finally, the server supports the authoring of custom tasks that can be run at regular
    intervals or on demand when a user commits a transaction in the database.</p>

    <p><img src="gifs/adminTasks.gif"></p>

    <p>Again, you may wish to consult the javadoc's for documentation on the base class for all
    plug-in tasks on the server.  Currently, all plug-in tasks are run whenever a transaction
    is committed by a user.  In the future we will make it easier to plug-in custom tasks to
    be run at arbitrary times by the server.</p>
