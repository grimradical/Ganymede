    <p>This example will show how the different permissions objects
    operate together.  It doesn't have very an in-depth discussion of
    the implications of the different permission bits yet.<p>
      
    <p>Let's say you want to set up a small group of users, and give
    them control over their own resources.  Usually this would require
    the creation of an administrator, who would then create his own
    objects.</p>

    <p>The user we have chosen to be in charge of this group is <font
    color=#FF0000>Ahab</font>.  Ahab will be given control of a new
    Owner Group, called <font color=#FF0000>Pequod</font>.  We will
    also make a new Role for Ahab, called <font
    color=#FF0000>Captain</font>.</p>

<p>The names here are meant to show how ownership of instances and
types can be shared.  Ahab may be given another ship to control, which
could be another owner group called the Santa Maria.  He would own
everything on the Santa Maria, and would have the permissions of a
Captain on both ships.  Also, each ship could be controlled by another
admin, say the Queen of France operating with the Monarch role.  There
could be other Captains of other ships, like Captain Picard of the
Owner Group Enterprise.  Picard would have the same control over the
objects in the Enterprise as Ahab has over the objects on the
Pequod.</p>

<p>First we will make the new Owner Group.  This is created just like
any object.  In this case, I use the tree to create a new Owner Group.
I call it <font color=#FF0000>Pequod</font>.  Don't worry about the
other fields in the Owner Group for now; we have to create the other
objects before we can link them.  Next comes the Role.  I create the
Role in the same way: by right clicking on the Role node in the tree.
I call the Role <font color=#FF0000>Captain</font>, because I might
use this same role for other users who have their own ships.

<p>When creating the Role, we have to set up permissions.  There are
two permission fields: Owned Objects Bits and Default Bits.  Remember
that Ahab is going to be in the <font color=#FF0000>Pequod</font> 
owner group, so the Owned Objects Bits permissions will
apply to the objects on the <font color=#FF0000>Pequod</font>.
The Default Bits are used for all other objects.  I set up the
permissions as shown, because I only want Ahab to be able to do a
little bit of administrating(he's not all that trustworthy).

<p>As far as the default bits go, I want him to be able to edit the
member list of groups which he doesn't own.  This will allow him to
add his own users to groups, but he won't be able to take users he
doesn't own out of groups, because he doesn't have premission to edit
the groups field of the users he doesn't own.  Yikes.

<p>Note that I cannot create a Role with more permissions than my own.
For example, if my Admin Persona can't create Users, then Ahab can't
either.

<p>Now that I have created a Role and an Owner Grouf for Ahab, it's
time to create Ahab's admin persona.  This is wher everything will be
linked together.  In order to create an Admin Persona, I edit Ahab's
user object, and click on the Admin Personae tab.  To create a new
persona, I just click on the "Create" button at the bottom of the
window.  

<p>The name of an Admin Persona must start with the user's name,
followed by a colon.  In this case, I will call the new persona <font
color=#FF0000>Ahab:Captain</font>.  After setting the password, I add the
<font color=#FF0000>Pequod</font> Owner Group to the "Owner
Sets" field.  Then I add <font color=#FF0000>Captain</font> to the
"Roles" field.

<p>Ok, Ahab is ready to go.  Now when Ahab logs in, he can change to his
admin persona with the persona menu, and start to create his new group
of friends.
