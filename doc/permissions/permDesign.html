<p>One of the critical elements of Ganymede's design is the
permissions model.  Ganymede needs a universal permissions model that
allows complete flexibility in apportioning privileges to classes of
users/adminstrators, without becoming so unwieldy as to be
impractical.</p>

<p>The solution is a 2 level object model, where individual 
<font color="#FF0000">Users</font> are associated with multiple
<font color="#FF0000">Admin Personae</font>.  Upon logging into Ganymede, a
user will be able to select which Persona he or she wishes to work as,
with an 'su'-like facility for switching Personae.  Each of these
Admin Persona may be a member of multiple <font color="#FF0000">Owner
Groups</font>.  All objects are owned by these owner groups, which
allows adminstrators to be granted privileges to a wide range of
objects without having to have someone go through all the objects in
the Ganymede database and change the owner list.  An invidual object
in the Ganymede database may be owned by multiple owner groups.</p>

<p>The Admin Persona object is associated with a Ganymede login,
confers membership in a variable number of Owner Groups, and has an
associated list of <font color = "#FF0000">Role</font> objects.  Each
Role object contains two <font color = "#FF0000">Permissions
Matrices</font>: one for objects owned, and one for default
persmissions.  These permission matrices contain an array of booleans
which allow access to the database by object type and field, with
create, edit, view, and delete permissions categories.  These
permissions bits are combined together across all of an Admin
Persona's permission matrices, and filters the admin Persona's
permissions when accessing any object in the Ganymede database.  A
large set of Admin Personae may be configured with the same
Permissions Matrix object, allowing for central permissions
administration.</p>

<p>The combination of the <font color = "#FF0000">Owner Groups</font>,
which determine which objects are accessible, and the <font color =
"#FF0000">Roles</font>, which determine what can be done to those
objects, provides complete flexibility while maintaining the ability
to make wide-ranging changes in the authorization schema by the simple
editing of one or two objects in the Ganymede database.</p>

<p>Although it is not shown explicitly in the below diagram, all of
the objects shown are themselves owned by Owner Groups, so the system
is self-administering.  The same permissions system that
controls access to the Ganymede database also controls access to the
controls themselves.  There is a special owner group, called
'supergash', in the system.  All Admin Personae that are members of
this owner group have full privileges in the system, and can bootstrap
this authorization schema.</p>

<p>As powerful as this system is, it is not complete.  There will be
cases where a more specialized permissions model is required.  Take
for instance the case of maintaining a public mailing list that users
should be able to add and remove themselves, but not touch any other
user in the list.  This can be accomplished through the authoring of
custom plug-in classes which can provide any level of intelligence
needed to objects of a given type.</p>
