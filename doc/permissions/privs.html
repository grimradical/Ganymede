    <h1>Ganymede Privileges, Ownership, and Admin Personae</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>One of the lessons learned from the development and use of GASH
    was that it is important to have as flexible a permissions system
    as possible.  GASH's permissions model was highly <i>ad hoc</i>, and
    differed for each kind of object managed by GASH.  The Ganymede
    Server uses a much more detailed and flexible permissions model.</p>

    <p>You can read a detailed discussion of the Ganymede permissions model
    <a href="permDesign.html">here</a>.  This document will illustrate
    the prinicples through screen shots of the client in action.</p>

            ownergroups, admin personae, and role objects.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>All objects in the server are owned by owner groups.  Each owner group
            has a name, a set of admin personae as members, and a set of objects that
            it (nonexclusively) owns.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>The members of owner groups are known as admin personae.  Each admin persona is
          associated with a Ganymede user account, with the exception of the special
          supergash and monitor admin personae.</p>
          <p>An admin persona is a member of 0 or more owner groups, and is said to own
          all objects owned by those owner groups (and by owner groups owned by those
          owner groups and so on, recursively).</p>

        <td><img align="left" src="admin-persona.gif" alt="Admin Persona Img"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr bgcolor="#CCFFCC">
        <td colspan="2"><h2><b>Roles</b></h2></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>An admin persona's access to fields is controlled by the
          permission sets in the Role the admin persona is associated
          with.  Each admin persona can be associated with one or more
          Roles, which collectively grant permission to access certain
          object types and certain fields of those objects.</p>

          <p>Each Role contains two permission arrays.  One array
          determines the permissions that an admin persona has on
          objects owned by that admin (through the owner groups), and
          one determines what access an admin has to objects not
          specifically owned by that admin.  This can be used to give
          an admin the ability to view certain pieces of information
          about any user, group, system, etc., in the Ganymede
          server.</p>

          <p>Finally, there is a default Role, with its own permission
          sets, which controls what minimum privileges all users have,
          and specifically what permission end users have.</p>

          <p>All users registered in Ganymede have the nominal right
          to log in to the server, and will generally be able to do
          things like change their phone number, password, and so on.</p>
