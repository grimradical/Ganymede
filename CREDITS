Ganymede Developer Release 0.94
January 21, 1999
CREDITS
---------------------------------------------

Ganymede has been under development for nearly 3 years now, in both
planning and execution.  The work has primarily been performed in
the Computer Science Division of The Applied Research Laboratories,
The University of Texas at Austin, with support from CSD and ARL
management.

The development of Ganymede has benefited from the direct development
contributions of the following individuals:

--

 Navin Manohar, current email unknown

 Navin worked on Ganymede from its inception in late 1995 through his
departure from the lab in April of 1997.  Navin contributed to initial
architecture design decisions during this time, as well as the initial
development of the client, including the basic framework within which
the client was developed.  He developed the excellent calendar GUI
component that is used in the client, as well as the more unobtrusive
but vital GUI components that the client uses for data entry.

--

 Erik Grostic, butcher@auschron.com

 Erik worked on Ganymede from mid 1997 through his departure from the
lab in December of 1997.  Erik developed the GUI code for the
permissions editor and the query submission dialog,
helping bring the client into fruition.

--

 Brian O'Mara, omara@arlut.utexas.edu

 Brian is currently working at ARL as a student employee.  Brian has
created custom icons for the Ganymede client and rewrote the permissions
editor to use more Swing classes.

--

 Mike Mulvaney, mikem@mail.utexas.edu

 Mike worked on Ganymede during his year and a half at the lab, from
February of 1997 through September of 1998, before moving to the
Washington D.C. area.  The client as it currently stands is primarily
Mike's work.  In addition to the large bulk of client-side coding,
Mike contributed significantly to the design of the system
architecture as a whole.  Ganymede would be a far, far poorer thing
were it not for Mike.

--

 Jonathan Abbey, jonabbey@arlut.utexas.edu

 Jon initiated the Ganymede project with support from CSD and lab
management after shortcomings in the GASH system became apparent.  Jon
has been the primary architect and coder on the project, developing
the Ganymede server and admin console, and well as contributing the
table and tree GUI components used in both the admin console and
the primary client, as well as all of the CVS and build script work.

--

 Dan Scott, dscott@arlut.utexas.edu

 Dan originated the GASH project, providing strategic vision and
architectural design to solve the essential problem of shared group
control over the lab's master NIS and DNS databases.  Dan has
contributed greatly to the higher level design issues in Ganymede, as
well as providing invaluable user interface design feedback and bug
reporting.  Neither Ganymede nor GASH could have been developed at all
without his support.

------

Within ARL, Gil Kloepfer provided design assistance on the networking
issues that Ganymede is going to need to address as the lab moves into
the 21st century.  Jay Scott and Steve Kneuper contributed helpful
input on functionality and features.  Brian O'Mara did some work on
icons and graphics for the client. 

A lot of Ganymede is based on the experience and design work that went
into GASH.  In addition to the aforementioned names, Dean Kennedy and
Pug Bainter should be credited for their design work on GASH.  Pug
Bainter authored the original GASH makefiles that the Ganymede GASH
schema uses to propagate information from Ganymede into NIS and DNS.

Outside ARL, we have gotten very helpful bug reports and feedback
from:

Curtis King, curtis.king@cul.ca - detailed bug reports
Pug Bainter, pug@pug.net - install script bug reports, gash schema bug reports
Doug Floyd, dfloyd@io.com - bug reports and AIX testing
Matt Knopp, mhat@vorlon.com - FreeBSD testing, Sesame Chicken
Mike Clay, mclay@weareb.org - FreeBSD testing
Stephen L. Johnson, sjohnson@godzilla.monsters.org - bug reports
Matt Bush, xomox@netlag.com - beta testing, bug reports
Jher, jher@fnord.com - beta testing
Sheilagh O'Hare, martini@fc.net - design brilliance

The regular expression class library used in the server to provide regexp
search support is from the Free Software Foundation, and was written by
Wes Biggs <wes@cacas.org>.  See the gnu-regexp-1.0.5/README and
gnu-regexp-1.0.5/LICENSE for more details.

The Java implementation of the standard UNIX crypt() function was
converted from C by John Dumas, jdumas@zgs.com, whose code can be
found at http://208.223.9.21/jfd/crypt.html.  jcrypt is included in
Ganymede by permission of the author.

The Qsmtp class was written by James Driscoll (maus@io.com), and
placed into the public domain.  See
http://www.io.com/~maus/JavaPage.html for details and additional
free Java code.
