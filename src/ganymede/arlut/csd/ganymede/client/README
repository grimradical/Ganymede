README -- client

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the code for the Ganymede GUI and XML clients.
The glogin class is the entry point for the Ganymede GUI client.  It
is dual-mode, which means that it can be launched as a Java
application (using the main() entry point) or as an applet, since it
is subclassed from javax.swing.JApplet.

This directory also contains the ClientBase class, which is designed
to serve as the nucleus of any Ganymede client written in Java,
and which handles the necessary client/server communications.
