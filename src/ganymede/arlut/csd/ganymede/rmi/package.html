<p>Remote interfaces for the Ganymede system.</p>

<p>This package contains all of the remote interface definitions that
can be used to make remote method calls on objects in the Ganymede
server via RMI.</p>

<p>In addition to the interfaces in this package, some objects can be
passed via serialization from the Ganymede server to the Ganymede
client and admin console.  The class definitions for those objects can
be found in {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.common}.</p>
