<p>The Ganymede server implementation.</p>

<p>Includes all classes and interfaces that comprise the Ganymede
server and which are not intended to be directly referenced or used by
the Ganymede client or admin console.</p>

<p>The Ganymede server's <code>main()</code> entrypoint is in the
{@link arlut.csd.ganymede.server.Ganymede} class.  The main() method
is responsible for bootstrapping the Ganymede server and getting it
ready for use.</p>

<p>Here is the general order of operations for server startup:</p>

<ol>

<li>A {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBStore} singleton object is
created which manages Ganymede data storage.  Data is loaded by
DBStore into memory from a <code>ganymede.db</code> file on disk,
supplemented by any non-consolidated transaction records in the
Ganymede <code>journal</code> file.</li>

<li>A single {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeServer}
object is created for the server's internal use.</li>

<li>The server starts a singleton {@link
arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeScheduler} which handles the
scheduling of server-side tasks on independent threads.  {@link
arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeBuilderTask} and {@link
arlut.csd.ganymede.server.SyncRunner} objects which are specified in
the Ganymede data store are registered in the scheduler.</li>

<li>The server creates a singleton {@link
arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBLog} object which handles logging and
email notification for the server.  A {@link Qsmtp.Qsmtp} object is
created which spawns a thread for transmitting email generated by
Ganymede.</li>

<li>An RMI registry is created and bound to a specified network port
so that clients can create RMI connections to get access to the
server.</li>

<li>The previously created GanymedeServer object is registered in the
registry.  Clients and admin consoles can now connect to the server
and call methods on the {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.rmi.Server} remote
interface.  Methods in this interface can in turn return remote
references to other objects created in the Ganymede server, through
which work is done with the server.</li>

</ol>

<p>At this point, the server is started and ready for operations.  All
server operations from this point on will be initiated by the Ganymede
Scheduler which is running on its own background thread, or by clients
who have connected to the server through RMI.  All RMI calls to the
server are serviced on independent threads, which cooperate in a
multithreaded context via a number of synchronization and queueing
systems in the Ganymede server.</p>

<p>Normal clients connect to the server via a call to the Server
interface's {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.rmi.Server#login(String,String)}
method, which returns a remote RMI reference that implements the
{@link arlut.csd.ganymede.rmi.Session} interface which is backed on
the server by a client-facing {@link
arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeSession} object.  Each client has
its own GanymedeSession object, which lives in the server for the
duration of the client's connection and which is responsible for
tracking security restrictions on the client and providing
appropriately limited access.</p>

<p>Each GanymedeSession, in turn, references a unique {@link
arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBSession} object which is responsible for
supporting operations on the server's single underlying {@link
arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBStore} database object.</p>

<p>Each DBSession contains a reference to a unique {@link
arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBEditSet} transaction manager which
coordinates checkpointing, rollback, and commit for changes made by
that DBSession.</p>
