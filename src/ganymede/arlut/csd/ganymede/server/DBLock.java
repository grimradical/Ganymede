/**
 * <p>DBLocks arbitrate access to {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBObjectBase DBObjectBase} objects in the
 * Ganymede server's {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBStore DBStore}.
 * Threads wishing to read from, dump, or update object bases in the
 * DBStore must be in possession of an established DBLock.  The
 * general scheme is that any number of readers and/or dumpers can
 * read from an object base simultaneously.  If a number of readers are
 * processing when a thread attempts to establish a write lock, those
 * readers are allowed to complete their reading, but no new read lock
 * may be established until the writer has a chance to get in and make
 * its update.</p>
 * 
 * <p>If there are a number of writer locks queued up for update
 * access to a DBObjectBase in the DBStore when a thread attempts to
 * establish a dump lock, those writers are allowed to complete their
 * updates, but no new writer is queued until the dump thread finishes
 * dumping the locked bases.</p>
 *
 * <P>All of this priority logic is implemented in the establish()
 * methods of the concrete DBLock subclasses.</P>
 *
 * <P>As mentioned above, all DBLock's are issued in the context of
 * one or more {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBObjectBase DBObjectBase}
 * objects.  The DBObjectBases are actually the things being locked.
 * To maintain multi-threaded safety of the lock system across
 * multiple DBObjectBases, the DBLock {@link
 * arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBLock#establish(java.lang.Object) establish()}
 * and {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBLock#release() release()} methods
 * (as implemented in {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBReadLock
 * DBReadLock}, {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBReadLock DBWriteLock}, and
 * {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.server.DBReadLock DBDumpLock}) are all
 * synchronized on the Ganymede's DBStore object.  This
 * synchronization is critical for the proper functioning of the
 * DBLock system.</P>
 * 
 * <p>There is currently no support for handling timeouts, and locks can persist
 * indefinitely.  However, the {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.server.GanymedeSession GanymedeSession}
 * class will detect a client that has died, and will properly clean up any
 * locks held by the user.</p>
