<p>Classes and interfaces that are used in common among the Ganymede
server, client, and admin console.</p>

<p>Almost all of the classes in this package implement the {@link
java.io.Serializable} interface so that they can be passed as data
transport objects over RMI between the Ganymede server, client, and
admin console.</p>

<p>Others, such as the {@link arlut.csd.ganymede.common.windowSizer}
class, are not serializable, but instead are intended to be used by
code in multiple other Ganymede packages.  In the case of windowSizer,
it is used in both the admin console and the Swing gui client.</p>

<p>In addition to the classes in this package, there are a handful of
interfaces that provide constants which are used across the server,
client, and admin console.</p>

<p>While data transport objects are defined in this package, the
remote interfaces defining supported remote method calls are defined
in the objects can be passed via serialization {@link
arlut.csd.ganymede.rmi} package.</p>
