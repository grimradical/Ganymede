/**
 * <P>This class is intended to serve as a stream-oriented pull proxy, allowing
 * the Ganymede server to read XML entity and character data from a SAX parser
 * entity by entity, rather than through the use of a callback interface, as is
 * traditionally done with SAX.</P>
 *
 * <P>When instantiated, the XMLReader creates a background thread that receives
 * SAX events from James Clark's XP XML parser.  These SAX events are converted
 * to {@link arlut.csd.Util.XMLItem XMLItem} objects and saved in an internal
 * buffer.  The user of the XMLReader class calls getNextItem() to retrieve
 * these XMLItem objects from the XMLReader buffer, in order of receipt.</P>
 *
 * <P>The background parse thread is throttled back as needed to avoid overflowing
 * the XMLReader's internal buffer.</P>
