GASH README
----------------------------

The schema classes and source code found in this directory implement a
database definition for holding the information that the GASH program
held.  This directory includes 3 main pieces:

1) custom.jar

   This java class archive contains all the custom code for a set
   of plug-in objects that we have created to provide GASH-style
   intelligence to the Ganymede database.

2) The source code for the plug-in classes that are contained in
   custom.jar

3) A ganymede.schema file in the custom_src directory.  This file
   contains the object definitions for the GASH objects that
   our GASH schema operates on.  This file was copied into
   db/ganymede.db by the installServer.perl script at server install
   time.

4) A loader directory that contains the code necessary to load a
   Ganymede database from a set of GASH files.

   The following GASH files are supported:

     user_info
     group_info
     admin_info
     host_info
     aliases_info
     auto.vol
     auto.home.*
     netgroup

   Your copies of the above files should be placed in the input
   directory.  You can then run the runDirectLoader script
   to generate the file loader/db/loader.db.  This file will
   contain all the information from your GASH files, including
   automatic generation of admin logins.

   You then can copy the loader.db file to the db directory
   under the server install directory and start the server.

Please see the file docs/privs.html for details on how ownership,
permissions, and admin personae work in Ganymede.
