README -- schemas

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory tree contains sources for the gasharl schema kit custom
code that we use at ARL:UT.  This tree does not contain any of the
external, auxiliary scripting components required to handle the
laboratory's build environment, but the sources might prove of
interest as an example of what can be done with the Ganymede API.
