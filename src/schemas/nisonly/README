NIS README
----------------------------

The schema classes and source code found in this directory implement a
database definition for holding basic NIS information

1) custom.jar

   This java class archive contains all the custom code for a set
   of plug-in objects that we have created to provide 
   intelligence concerning the NIS data structures to the Ganymede
   database.

2) The source code for the plug-in classes that are contained in
   custom.jar

3) A ganymede.schema file in the custom_src directory.  This file
   contains the object definitions for the NIS objects that
   our NIS schema operates on.  This file was copied into
   db/ganymede.db by the installServer.perl script at server install
   time.

4) A loader directory that contains the code necessary to load a
   Ganymede database from a simplified set of NIS files.

   The following NIS/etc files are supported:

     passwd
     group

   Your copies of the above files should be placed in the input
   directory.  You can then run the runDirectLoader script
   to generate the file loader/db/ganymede.db.  This file will
   contain all the information from your NIS files.

   There is obviously a lot more that can be held in NIS that you
   might want to manage through Ganymede, but we are providing this
   simplified schema so that any unix admin team can successfully
   experiment with running Ganymede from your existing files.

   Note that unlike the GASH schema, the NIS loader code has no way
   of identifying or setting up privileged administrators.  If you
   use the NIS schema, you will wind up needing to log in to Ganymede
   with the superuser accout (default username: supergash, pass:
   newpass).

   Once you have logged in with supergash, you can create new owner
   groups and permission objects, then edit your admin user accounts
   to give them admin personae to work with.

NOTE: The passwd handling code assumes that the gcos field will be
compatible with Solaris/AIX style formatting:

broccol:*:12003:12010:Jonathan Abbey,S321 CSD,3199,3021748:/home/broccol:/bin/tcsh
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^
                      Full Name      Room Div OfficePhone HomePhone

If you are using another version of UNIX, you may need to edit
custom_src/NISBuilderTask.java and loader/source/User.java to make the
nisonly custom code write and read your gcos field variant
appropriately.

Please see the file doc/privs.html for details on how ownership,
permissions, and admin personae work in Ganymede.
