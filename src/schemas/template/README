Ganymede Template Schema README
-------------------------------

This directory was installed because you installed the Ganymede server
without a schema kit.  The installServer script has placed config.sh
files in the directories contained hereunder to customize the build
scripts you'll also find here.

The custom_src directory is where you can put .java files for custom
subclasses of arlut.csd.ganymede.DBEditObject and
arlut.csd.ganymede.GanymedeBuilderTask.  The build script will compile
.java files placed here, and buildCustomJar will package them all into
a custom.jar file for use by the server.

The loader directory is where you can put your code for taking
pre-existing data files and processing them with a runDirectLoader
script into a ganymede.db directory.  You'll need a ganymede.schema
file dumped from the Ganymede server after using the schema editor in
the loader directory, as well as custom code for processing your input
files and generating the ganymede.db file with the loaded data.  Take
a look at the source code in the defined schema kits to see how this
is done.
