--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory tree contains pieces to support the use of Jython in
implementing DBEditObject and GanymedeBuilderTask plugin classes in
the Ganymede server.

None of this is documented yet, and won't actually do anything unless
you include the telnet=<portnum> in the runServer script, or unless
you configure a DBEditObject or GanymedeBuilderTask plugin to use a
Jython-implemented class.  Which is not documented, so don't worry
about it for now.
