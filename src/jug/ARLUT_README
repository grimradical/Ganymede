This is an excerpted portion of Version 1.1 of doomdark.org's Java
UUID Generator package.  It requires Java 1.2 or greater, and provides
standard UUID generation algorithms so that Ganymede can master UUID
codes for synchronization into Apple's Open Directory.

The original package included an Ant-based build system.  When I get
around to shifting the Ganymede source tree around to Ant, I'll have
to revisit this directory and put it back under Ant, probably by
dropping this directory entirely in favor of a full copy of the JUG
package.
