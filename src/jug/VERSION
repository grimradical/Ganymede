Version: 1.1

Release date: 09-December-2003

Description:
  First significant 1.x release, adds FreeBSD/x86 native MAC address
  access, fixes a Windows native code bug, and introduces a full
  unit test suite.

History:
  0.9a: First public (alpha) release
  0.9.1: Minor improvements and fixes:
	- UUID and EthernetAddress are now serializable
	- Added some more comments
	- UUID hash code now cached
	- Can turn off desc caching of UUID
	- Renamed 'fromByteArray' in UUID; should be 'toByteArray'
  0.9.2: New UUID constructor to make it easier to store binary representation
	of UUIDs. Thanks to Leonid Kunin for pointing these out.

  0.9.3: Minor improvements:
	- UUID and EthernetAddress now Cloneable
	- UUID and EthernetAddress now Comparable; can sort them (useful
	  for ordering time-based UUIDs based on creation time)
	- EthernetAddress can be converted to/from long
	- Improved test suites for UUIDs and EthernetAddresses (invoke
	  by calling main() - method directly)

  0.9.4: Trivial improvements:
	- Added copyright clauses to source files (which also mention
	  licensing)
	- Added 'isNullUUID()' method to UUID class (plus also matching
	  testing to UUIDGenerator's test harness

  1.0.0: Added native modules for obtaining Ethernet MAC address (see
	CREDITS for details about source of these sources)

  1.0.1: Minor fixes:
	- UUID.java class (bug in toByteArray() fixed)
	- Updated README file to contain reference to a new IETF draft:

	  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mealling-uuid-urn-00.txt

	  which describes UUIDs as well as presents a suggested way for
	  'encapsulating' UUIDs in a URN name space.

  1.0.2: Minor updates:
     - Native code can now be loaded either from application specific
       location (default case, supported since 1.0.0), or from
	   system-dependant standard lib location (new to 1.0.2)
     - Trying to add ant build support to replace make. Not yet
	   fully done.

  1.0.3: Better native support, a minor bugfix.
     - Bug fix to UUID.java class (another bug in toByteArray(),
       or potentially regressed first one?)
     - Mac OS X native MAC address access support (for primary
       interface)
     - Small improvements Ant build definitions (need to include targets
       for doing JavaDocs and source distribution
     - Added BUGS file that contains known problems.

  1.1. Better native support, full unit test suite.
     - Fixed a bug in Windows MAC address access, which would cause
       infinite loop under some conditions on Win9x/2K/XP.
     - Added FreeBSD/x86 native code.
     - Added full unit test suite.
     - Fixed a bug in dummy ethernet broadcast generation code.
     - Changed API to allow using any Random implementation, not just
       SecureRandom or its subclasses.
