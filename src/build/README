README -- build

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory tree contains build directories used by Ant when
building the Ganymede software.

Contained hereunder:

  The classes directory contains the compiled class files.

  The crypto directory contains the cryptographic key material created
  by the ant genkeys/regenkeys targets.

  The lib directory contains the jar files produced by the ant jars
  target.

  The lib directory will also contain the third party jar files used
  to support the Ganymede build.  These jars are copied from ../lib by
  the Ant build.xml file during builds, and will need to be copied to
  the jars directory of the top level Ganymede distribution for
  installation by installServer, installClient, and installWeb.

  The doc directory is where the ant javadoc target will put the
  javadoc tree when built.
