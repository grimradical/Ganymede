README -- build

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory tree contains build directories used by Ant when
building the Ganymede software.

Contained hereunder:

  The classes directory contains the compiled class files.

  The crypto directory contains the cryptographic key material created
  by the ant genkeys/regenkeys targets.

  The lib directory contains the jar files produced by the ant jars
  target.

  The lib directory will also contain the antlr.jar file used to
  support the ANTLR-derived parser Deepak wrote as a tool for Jython
  use.  It is copied from ../lib by the Ant build.xml file during
  builds.

  The doc directory is where the ant javadoc target will put the
  javadoc tree when built.
