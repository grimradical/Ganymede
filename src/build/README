--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory tree contains build directories used by Ant when
building the Ganymede software.

Contained hereunder:

  The classes directory contains the compiled class files.

  The crypto directory contains the cryptographic key material created
  by the ant genkeys/regenkeys targets.

  The lib directory contains the jar files produced by the ant jars
  target, as well as the antlr.jar file used to support the
  ANTLR-derived parser Deepak wrote as a tool for Jython use, and the
  gnu-regexp-1.1.4.jar file used to support the use of GNU Regexp in
  the Ganymede server.  These files, in fact, are copied from ../lib
  by the Ant build.xml file when you build stuff.

  The doc directory is where the ant javadoc target will put the
  javadoc tree when built.
