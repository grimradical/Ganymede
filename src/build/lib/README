README -- lib

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory tree contains jar files used by the Ganymede build
process.  The ant build.xml file will copy these to ../build/lib
during the build so as to put the jar files in the Ant class path.

No, I'm not sure why this is necessary either.  Deepak?
