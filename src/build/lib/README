Ganymede Release 2.0
13 October 2009
src/lib/README

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory tree contains jar files used by the Ganymede build
process.  The ant build.xml file will copy these to ../build/lib
during the build so as to put the jar files in the Ant class path.

antlr.jar is from Terence Parr's ANTLR parser generator, which he has
placed in the public domain.

See http://www.antlr.org/ for information on ANTLR.

jarbundler-2.1.0.jar provides Seth J. Morabito's Mac OS X JarBundler
Ant task, as further developed by Will Gilbert.  It was downloaded
from http://informagen.com/JarBundler/ to provide Macintosh-specific
application packaging of the Ganymede clients.

The JarBundler project is licensed under the Apache Software License
v2.0 (ASLv2).

MRJToolkitStubs-1.0.jar contains a set of stub classes that will
provide link resolution for the Ganymede clients on non-Mac platforms.

When running the Ganymede clients on the Mac, the Apple-provided
classes will override the classes in the MRJToolkitStubs-1.0.jar
archive, providing Mac OS X specific functionality.

The mac_widgets.jar file provides a very Mac-like appearance when
running the Ganymede client on the Macintosh.  It was downloaded from
http://code.google.com/p/macwidgets/.

Mac Widgets is by Kenneth Orr, and is licensed under the Gnu Lesser
General Public License.

The forms-1.3.0pre4.jar file used to provide support features for
Kenneth Orr's Mac Widgets.  It was downloaded from
http://www.jgoodies.com/downloads/libraries.html, using the 'JGoodies
Forms' link.

JGoodies Forms is by the JGoodies company, Karsten Lentzsch, founder.

JGoodies Forms is licensed under the permissive BSD license.
