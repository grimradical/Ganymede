Ganymede Release 2.0
8 October 2009
src/lib/README

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory tree contains jar files used by the Ganymede build
process.  The ant build.xml file will copy these to ../build/lib
during the build so as to put the jar files in the Ant class path.

antlr.jar is from Terence Parr's ANTLR parser generator, which he has
placed in the public domain.

See http://www.antlr.org/ for information on ANTLR.

jarbundler-2.1.0.jar provides Seth J. Morabito's Mac OS X JarBundler
Ant task, as further developed by Will Gilbert.  It was downloaded
from http://informagen.com/JarBundler/ to provide Macintosh-specific
application packaging of the Ganymede clients.

The JarBundler project is licensed under the Apache Software License
v2.0 (ASLv2).
