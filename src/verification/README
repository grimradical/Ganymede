--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory tree contains a modest set of support files used to
help with verification and testing of the Ganymede tree.

The resource_validator.pl file is a Perl script used to verify that
string localization statements in the Ganymede source tree mate up
properly with the localization resources in ../resources.

The translation_validator.pl file is a Perl script used to check
non-default language translation files against the default
localization property files.  It reports on translation coverage and
does some elementary error checking.

The Modules subdirectory contains Perl support modules used by the
resource_validator.pl and translation_validator.pl scripts.

To use these localization checking scripts, run 'ant validate' in the
../src directory.

The launchers directory contains utility scripts to run the Ganymede
software under the Emma code coverage tool.  These scripts are for use
during development and debugging.
