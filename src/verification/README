This directory tree contains a modest set of support files used to
help with verification and testing of the Ganymede tree.

The resource_validator.pl file is a Perl script used to verify that
string localization statements in the Ganymede source tree mates up
properly with the localization resources in ../resources.

The Modules subdirectory contains Perl support modules used by the
resource_validator.pl script.

To use the resource_validator script to check the sources for proper
string localization, run 'ant validate' in the ../src directory.

The launchers directory contains utility scripts to run the Ganymede
software under the Emma code coverage tool.  These scripts are for use
during development and debugging.
