---------------------------------------------

Greetings.  Ganymede is a Java-based directory management software
system we at the Computer Science Division of ARL:UT have been
developing since 1995.

This release includes:

  The Ganymede server, an extendable database and application server
  that supports custom plug-ins for object types held in the database
  and for tasks that can be run in the server to do directory
  propagation to NIS, DNS, and the like.

  A full-featured Ganymede client, providing a convenient
  Explorer-like interface to all operations supported by the server.

  A GUI Administration Console, which can be used to monitor
  the server's operations, and to modify the design of the database
  held in the server.

  Comprehensive documentation on all classes and methods comprising
  the server and the primary client.

  Source code for the core module of any Ganymede client.

  Templates for running the admin console and primary client off of
  a Java-enabled web browser.

  Full source code for everything.

Things you will need to get started:

  A Java 1.4 or better compliant JVM to run the server, client, and
  admin console.

  Perl 5 to run the install scripts, and Ant to build the software.

  A web server to provide the clients to your users for remote
  execution.
