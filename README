Ganymede Release 1.0.10
April 2, 2002
README
---------------------------------------------

Greetings.  Ganymede is a Java-based directory management software
system we at the Computer Science Division of ARL:UT have been
developing for the past 6 years.

This release includes:

  The Ganymede server, an extendable database and application server
  that supports custom plug-ins for object types held in the database
  and for tasks that can be run in the server to do directory
  propagation to NIS, DNS, and the like.

  A full-featured Ganymede client, providing a convenient
  Explorer-like interface to all operations supported by the server.

  A GUI Administration Console, which can be used to monitor
  the server's operations, and to modify the design of the database
  held in the server.

  Comprehensive documentation on all classes and methods comprising
  the server and the primary client.

  Source code for the core module of any Ganymede client.

  Templates for running the admin console and primary client off of
  a Java-enabled web browser.

  Full source code for everything.

Things you will need:

  A JDK 1.1.7 or better compliant JVM to run the server, client, and
  admin console.  We recommend using Sun's JDK 1.3 where you can.
  JDK 1.3 on UNIX thus far only seems to support 8 and 24 bit color
  displays and performs poorly on remote displays.  For this reason,
  the Ganymede client and admin console are designed to be able to
  work with JDK 1.1.7 as well as 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4.

  If you intend to use the Ganymede clients with a 1.1 series JDK, you
  will need to download Swing 1.1 (or later) from Sun.  Swing 1.1.1
  has *many* bugs fixed relative to Swing 1.1, and should be used if
  at all possible. You can download this from
  http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html.

  Versions of Swing before Swing 1.1 will NOT work, as Ganymede is now
  built to use the javax version of the Swing libraries.  Probably 
  the best thing to do is to install the latest JDK 1.3 package, which
  includes an up-to-date Swing.  Most of the client testing on the
  current release has been performed with JDK 1.1.8 on Solaris,
  JDK 1.4 beta on Linux, and JDK 1.3 on Windows.

  Lots of bugs in Swing and JDK have been fixed in JDK 1.3.. get it
  or 1.4 if you can.

  Perl 5 to run the install scripts.

  If you want to run the Ganymede client or admin console on a Win32
  machine, download the latest version of the Java Runtime Environment
  (1.4.0 at this writing) from http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/.
  You can also use Sun's Java Web Start product at
  http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/ if you would prefer
  not to have to run the clients from within a web browser.
