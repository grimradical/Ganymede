Ganymede Release 1.0 prerelease beta 2
September 15, 2000
README
---------------------------------------------

Greetings.  Ganymede is a Java-based directory management software
system we at the Computer Science Division of ARL:UT have been
developing for the past 4 years.

This release includes:

  The Ganymede server, an extendable database and application server
  that supports custom plug-ins for object types held in the database
  and for tasks that can be run in the server to do directory
  propagation to NIS, DNS, and the like.

  A full-featured Ganymede client, providing a convenient
  Explorer-like interface to all operations supported by the server.

  A full-featured Administration Console, which can be used to monitor
  the server's operations, and to modify the design of the database
  held in the server.

  Sample database configurations, including both the database
  definition file and custom plug-in classes to match.

  Comprehensive documentation on all classes and methods comprising
  the server and the primary client.

  Source code for all custom classes, and for an example password
  client that can talk directly to the Ganymede server.

  Source code for the core module of any Ganymede client.

  Templates for running the admin console and primary client off of
  a Java-enabled web browser.

  A Java program to load data from NIS maps and/or GASH files into
  the Ganymede server.

  Build scripts that can take NIS and DNS information from the
  Ganymede server and propagate the information into NIS maps or
  DNS tables when the GASH schema is used.

  Full source code for everything.

Things you will need:

  A JDK 1.1.7 or better compliant JVM to run the server, client, and
  admin console.  We recommend using Sun's JDK 1.2.2 where you can.
  JDK 1.2 on UNIX thus far only seems to support 8 and 24 bit color
  displays.

  Swing 1.1 (or later) from Sun.  Swing 1.1.1 has *many* bugs fixed
  relative to Swing 1.1, and should be used if at all possible. You
  can download this from http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html.  

  Versions of Swing before Swing 1.1 will NOT work, as Ganymede is now
  built to use the javax version of the Swing libraries.  Probably 
  the best thing to do is to install the latest JDK 1.3 package, which
  includes an up-to-date Swing.  Most of the client testing on the
  current release has been performed with JDK 1.1.8 on Solaris and
  JDK 1.3 on Windows.

  The Ganymede client in version 0.99.9 has been tested running on Kestrel,
  the new JDK 1.3 beta on Windows.  Neither the server nor the admin
  console have yet been tested on Kestrel.

  Lots of bugs in Swing and JDK have been fixed in JDK 1.2.2.. get it
  if you can.

  Perl 5 to run the install scripts.

  Note that the HTML for the Ganymede client and admin pages have not
  yet been updated to prompt the user to go to a 1.2 specific plug-in
  page. Users without any version of the Java plugin installed may or
  may not be directed to the right page for downloading.

  If you want to run the Ganymede client or admin console on a Win32
  machine, download the latest version of the Java Runtime Environment
  (1.3.0 at this writing) from
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/download-windows.html.
