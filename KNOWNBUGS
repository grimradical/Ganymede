Ganymede Release 1.0 prerelease 1
January 30, 2001
KNOWNBUGS
----------------------------------------------

Ganymede release 1.0p1 requires Swing 1.1 or later, as it is built to
expect the Swing libraries to be in the package javax.swing, rather
than com.sun.java.swing, as it was in prior versions.  Use of Java JRE
1.3 for the clients is highly recommended, as many Swing bugs are
fixed in this release.

--

0) The Ganymede admin console will fail with security exceptions when
run in a browser with any Java 1.2 plugin prior to version 1.2.2, due
to a bug in thread permission allocations in early 1.2 JDK's.  If you
see problems with the Ganymede admin console, try the latest 1.3
plugin.
