Ganymede Developer Release 0.99.9
January 13, 2000
KNOWNBUGS
----------------------------------------------

Ganymede release 0.99.9 requires Swing 1.1 or later, as it is built to
expect the Swing libraries to be in the package javax.swing, rather
than com.sun.java.swing, as it was in prior versions.  Use of Java JRE
1.2.2 for the clients is highly recommended, as many Swing bugs are
fixed in this release.

Sun has just released Swing 1.1.1, which has lots and lots of bugs
fixed relative to Swing 1.1.  If you are running the Ganymede clients
on a UNIX system, be sure and get and install Swing 1.1.1.  If you are
running the Ganymede clients on Windows through your web browser, be
sure to use the latest version of the Java Runtime
Environment/Plug-in.

--

1) When using a pre-existing schema (gash/nisonly/bsd), the monitor
account name/ password is not properly reset.  It is, instead, user:
monitor, password: display.  If you start a new ganymede.db file
from scratch, the monitor account should be configured properly.

2) The gash and gasharl schemas are provided in 0.99.9 is intended to
enable the use of Ganymede as a 'drop-in' replacement for GASH.  There
are, however, a relatively small number of functions that are not
performed by Ganymede with the gash schemas.  These include the
automatic creation of users' home directories on user creation, and
the renaming of user's home directories and /var/mail mailboxes on
user rename.  Also, moving a user's home directory from automounter
volume to automounter volume does not yet trigger a specialized mail
message to be sent to the managers responsible for those volumes.

The logic to do these things has been sketched out in the
userCustom.java file in the schemas/{gash|gasharl}/custom_src
directory, but it is not yet complete to the point of calling external
scripts for these actions and, in fact, has been disabled in this
release.

See the README file in the schema directory if you choose to run
either of the gash schemas.

3) The 'Reload Custom Classes' menu item in the admin console doesn't
actually do anything very useful.  You need to stop and restart the
server if you have recompiled any plug-in classes.  It may be useful
if you have just used the schema editor to attach a plug-in class to
an object type, but it can't actually reload classes that were
previously loaded.

4) The bsd and linux schemas are preliminary.. it works, but the
larger assumptions embodied by the bsd schema code is still modeled
closely on the GASH model.  For instance, if you have users in the
master.passwd file whose gid references a group in the group file for
which that group does not have an explicit reference to the user.  All
of the wizards and schema logic embodied in the bsd schema still
assume that there won't be any purely implicit group membership
references in the user's gid field.

5) The Ganymede admin console will fail with security exceptions when
run in a browser with any Java 1.2 plugin prior to version 1.2.2, due
to a bug in thread permission allocations in early 1.2 JDK's.  If you
see problems with the Ganymede admin console, try the 1.2.2 plugin.
