Ganymede Developer Release 6a
December 4, 1998
KNOWNBUGS
----------------------------------------------

Ganymede developer's release 6 requires Swing 1.1 beta 3 or later,
as it is built to expect the Swing libraries to be in the
package javax.swing, rather than com.sun.java.swing, as it was
in prior versions.

--

1) When using a pre-existing schema (gash/nisonly/bsd), the monitor
account name/ password is not properly reset.  It is, instead, user:
monitor, password: display.  If you start a new ganymede.db file
from scratch, the monitor account should be configured properly.

2) The gash and gasharl schemas are provided in dev5c is intended to
enable the use of Ganymede as a 'drop-in' replacement for GASH.  There
are, however, a relatively small number of functions that are not
performed by Ganymede with the gash schemas.  These include the
automatic creation of users' home directories on user creation, and
the renaming of user's home directories and /var/mail mailboxes on
user rename.  Also, moving a user's home directory from automounter
volume to automounter volume does not yet trigger a specialized mail
message to be sent to the managers responsible for those volumes.

The logic to do these things has been sketched out in the
userCustom.java file in the schemas/{gash|gasharl}/custom_src
directory, but it is not yet complete to the point of calling external
scripts for these actions and, in fact, has been disabled in this
release.

See the README file in the schema directory if you choose to run
either of the gash schemas.

3) The 'Reload Custom Classes' menu item in the admin console doesn't
actually do anything very useful.  You need to stop and restart the
server if you have recompiled any plug-in classes.  It may be useful
if you have just used the schema editor to attach a plug-in class to
an object type, but it can't actually reload classes that were
previously loaded.

4) The bsd schema is preliminary.. it works, but the larger assumptions
embodied by the bsd schema code is still modeled closely on the
GASH model.  For instance, if you have users in the master.passwd
file whose gid references a group in the group file for which
that group does not have an explicit reference to the user.  All
of the wizards and schema logic embodied in the bsd schema still
assume that there won't be any purely implicit group membership
references in the user's gid field.

5) There are still a number of small gui bugs arising out of the Swing
libraries, as of Swing 1.1 beta 3.  In particular, the permissions
editor requires the user to click twice on a checkbox to set or clear
it.

6) Using the JDK 1.2 RC1 plug-in on Win32, the html files in the help,
'about ganymede', and MOTD will not be properly displayed.  This bug
has been reported to Sun, and will hopefully be fixed in the official
1.2 release.
