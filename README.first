Ganymede Release 1.0
May 31, 2001
README.first
---------------------------------------------

Welcome.  This thing that you just downloaded is version 1.0 of the
Ganymede network directory management system.

You should read the following documents to get oriented with Ganymede,
in roughly this order:

1. README
2. FAQ
3. INSTALL

Don't just rush to run 'configure' and expect to be able to do
something intelligent.  

Thank you, please drive through.
