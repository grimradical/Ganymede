---------------------------------------------

Welcome.  This thing that you just downloaded is version 2.0 of
the Ganymede network directory management system.

This archive contains the Ganymede server, clients, and documentation.

This archive does not contain customization code to make Ganymede
useful in any specific context.  You will want to download (or create)
a schema kit that provides a database schema, custom plug-in Java
classes to intelligently manage objects in your database, and both
Java code and external scripts to take data from the Ganymede database
and to propagate it into your network environment.  We have published
a 'userKit' package which customizes Ganymede for user and group
account management on UNIX, Windows NT, and Samba.

You should read the following documents to get oriented with the
Ganymede system, in roughly this order:

1. README
2. FAQ
3. INSTALL

Don't just rush to run 'configure' and expect to be able to put
something into production just like that.

Thank you, please drive through.
